<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 2 -->

The Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the Queen Dowager, who
was known by the humbler name of Mrs. E. Woodville, was let out
of prison, to which she had been consigned by Richard III., who
kept her closely under lock and key from the moment when he found
it impossible to unite her to him in wedlock.


Henry came up to London five days after the battle of Bosworth,
and was met at Hornsey by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, all
dressed in violet, which caused the new king to exclaim, " Ha !
gentlemen, you wish me to take a hint. Your privileges shall be,
like yourselves, in-violate ! " He then proceeded in a close chariot
to St. Paul's, where he deposited his three standards; and it has
been suggested, that the celebrated Standard at Cornhill was one of
those alluded to. The festivities in London were so numerous at
the accession, that the city became crowded to suffocation, and the
\"sweating sickness," which will be remembered as Stanley's old
complaint, broke out among the inhabitants. When it had abated
Henry began to think about his coronation, and he took an early
dinner at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Canterbury—Thomas
Bourchier—to talk the matter over. The king and the prelate soon
came to terms over their chop for the performance of the ceremony,
which took place on the 30th of October, 1485, in the usual style of
elegance. The good archbishop was an old and experienced hand :
for he had crowned Richard III. only two years before, and indeed
the system of the prelate was, to ask no questions that he might
hear no falsehoods; but he was always ready to perform a
coronation for any one who could find his own crown, and pay the fees that
were usual.


A Parliament was now summoned, but when the Commons came
together, it turned out that several of them had been attainted and
outlawed in previous reigns without the attainders having been
since reversed, and Henry himself was in the same doubtful
predicament. The opinion of the judges was required in this disagreeable
dilemma, but the intention in consulting them was only to get these
accommodating interpreters of the law to twist it into a shape that
would meet existing contingencies. With the usual pliability of the
judges of those days, the parties whose opinion was asked gave it in
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 3 -->
favour of the stronger side, and Henry's having got the crown was
declared to have cured all deficiencies of title. The Commons
were obliged to have bills passed to reverse their attainders, but
the king, like one of those patent fire-places which are advertised
to consume their own smoke, was alleged to have cured the defects
of his own title by the bare fact of his having got possession of
the royal dignity.

Having settled all matters concerning his claim to the throne, he
began to think about his intended wife, Elizabeth. " I beg your
pardon for keeping you waiting," said he to Miss Woodville; " but
really I have been detained by other engagements." The young
lady, who had sometimes feared that her case was one of breach of
promise, was glad to disguise her real annoyance, and saying that
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P23_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 4 -->
"It did not at all signify," she prepared for the much retarded
nuptials. They were solemnised on the 18th of January, 1486,
and they were no sooner over than Henry exclaimed, " Noav,
Madam, recollect I have married you, but have not married your
family." This uncourteous speech had reference to old Mrs.
Woodville, who had already written to know what her new son-in-law
would do for her. " I will not have her in the house," roared
Henry, with savage earnestness; but he settled a small annuity
upon her, which he enabled himself to pay by pocketing the whole
of her dower.


The queen became anxious for her coronation, as any woman
might reasonably be; but Henry put her off day after day, by
exclaiming, " Don't be in a hurry; there's time enough for that
nonsense." In this heartless manner he succeeded in adjourning
the pageant for an indefinite period.


Henry's next project was to get up his popularity by a tour in
the provinces. Happening to put up at Lincoln, he heard that Lord
Lovel, with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford, " had gone with
dangerous intentions no man knew whither." They had much better
have remained where they were; for Lord Lovel, after collecting a
large body of insurgents, found himself quite unable to pay their
wages, and at once disbanded them. He flew into ETanders; but
the two Staffords were taken in the very act of concocting an
insurrection, for which Humphrey, the elder, was hanged, while Thomas,
on account of his youth, was pardoned.


Henry arrived on the 26th of April, 1486, at York, where Richard
III., though killed on Bosworth Field, was still living in some of the
people's memories. The marking-ink, in which the tyrant's name
was written on their hearts, being by no means indelible, Henry
determined to sponge it out as quickly as possible. He tried soft
soap upon some and golden ointment upon others; both of which
specifics had so much effect that in less than a month the city rang
with cries of " Long live King Henry ! "


On the 20th of September, the Court newsman of the day
announced the interesting fact that the happiness of the king's
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 5 -->
domestic circle had been increased by the birth of a son; or, rather,
the royal circle had been turned into a triangle by the arrival of an
infant heir, who was named Arthur.


We must now request the reader to throw the luggage of his
imagination on board the boat, and accompany us to Ireland, where,
on landing, we will introduce him, ideally, to a priest and a boy
who have just arrived in Dublin. The priest describes his young
charge as Edward Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, which will astonish
us not a little, inasmuch as our friend, the reader, will remember
that we left the little fellow not long ago a close prisoner in the
Tower. How he got out is the question which we first ask ourselves,
which we answer by intimating, that he did not get out at all, but
he was only " a boy dressed up " to represent the young Earl, and
he played his part so well that many believed his story to be
genuine. He had studied the character he represented, and had got
by heart all the adventures of the young prince, together with a
fund of anecdote that appeared quite inexhaustible. The juvenile
impostor scarcely spoke a sentence that did not begin with " When
I was a prisoner in the Tower," which made every one believe that
he had really been an inmate of that gloomy jail; and the trick
succeeded to a miracle. The urchin was proclaimed as Edward VI.,
King of England and France and Lord of Ireland; for such was the
credulity of the Hibernians that they believed every word of the tale
that had been told to them. Henry, desirous of exposing the fraud,
had the real Plantagenet taken out of the Tower, for exhibition in
the London streets; but the Irish declared that the real thing was a
mere imposition, and the mock duke the genuine article. They, in
fact, illustrated that instructive fable, in which an actor, having been
applauded for his imitation of a pig, was succeeded by a rival who
went the whole hog and concealed in the folds of his dress a real
brute whose squeak was pronounced very far less natural than that
of the original representative of the porcine character.


Henry becoming a little alarmed at these proceedings, began
rushing into the extremes of levity and severity; now pardoning a
host of political offenders, and the next day, packing off the Queen
Dowager — marked "Carriage paid, with care," — to the monks
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 6 -->
at Bermondsey. Lambert Simnel, for so the impostor was called,
held out as long as he could, and even got up, by subscription, one
coronation during the season; but upon Elenry's taking measures
to chastise him he soon shrunk into insignificance. After a battle
at Stoke, the Pretender and his friend, the priest, were taken into
custody, when the latter was handed over to the church for trial, and
the former received a contemptuous pardon, including the place of

scullion, to wash up the dishes and run for the beer in the royal
household. He was at once placed in the kitchen, where his
perquisites, probably in the way of kitchen stuff, enabled him to save a
little money, and, in order to better himself, he subsequently sought
and obtained the office of superintendent of the poultry yard, under
the imposing title of the king's falconer. The priest, his tutor, seems
to have dropped down one of those gratings of the past, which lead
to the common sewer of obscurity, in which it is quite impossible to
follow him. We hear of him last looking through the bars of a
prison, where he was left till called for, and, as nobody ever called,
he never seems to have emerged from his captivity.

<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 7 -->

The friends of the house of York now became clamorous at the
treatment of the Queen Elizabeth, who had been kept in obscurity,
and had urged " that little matter of the coronation " over and over
again upon the attention of her selfish husband. " How you bother!"
he would sometimes exclaim to his unhappy consort, whom he would
endeavour to quiet by the philosophical inquiry of " What are the
odds, so long as you're happy ?"—a question which, as Elizabeth was
not happy, she found some difficulty in answering. At length, one
morning at breakfast, he said sulkily, " Well, I suppose I shall never
have any peace till that affair comes off; " and the necessary orders
for the coronation of the Queen were immediately given. Henry
himself behaved in a very ungentlemanly manner, during the
entire ceremony, for he viewed it from behind a screen,* which was
afterwards brought into the hall, to enable him to sit at his ease out
of sight, and take occasional peeps at the dinner. He had refused
to honour the proceedings with his presence, having declared the
ceremony to be " slow," and alleged the impossibility of his sitting
it out after having once suffered the infliction.


It was at about this period of the reign of Henry VII. that the
Court of Star Chamber was established; and though it, ultimately,f
\"became odious by the tyrannical exercise of its powers," its intentions
were originally as honourable as the most scrupulous of its suitors
could have desired. It was founded in consequence of the inefficiency
of the ordinary tribunals to do complete justice in criminal matters
and other offences of an extraordinary and dangerous characters and
to supply a sort of criminal equity—if we may be allowed the term—
which should reach the offences of great men, whom the inferior
judges and juries of the ordinary tribunals might have been afraid to
visit with their merited punishment.  
  
  
  It has been suggested with some plausibility that the court of Star


* The old Chroniclers affirm that he looked on "from behind a lattice." A
modern authority has it, that the king looked on at the dinner from behind a lettuce—
spelt lattice—and had a magnificent salad before him during the proceedings.

<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 8 -->
Chamber derived its name from the decorations of the room in which
it was held, though it is perhaps a more ingenious supposition of a
modern authority, that the word " Star " was applied to the court in
question because within its walls justice was administered in a
twinkling. It might, with as much reason, be suggested that the name had
reference to the constellation of legal talent of which the tribunal was
composed: for those stars of the first magnitude—the Lord Chancellor,
the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Privy Seal, and the President of the
Council—were all of them judges of the Court.


We must not, however, detain the reader any longer in a dull
court of law, for we find ourselves served, in imagination, with a writ
of IPabcas Corpus, commanding us to bring him up for the purpose
of inquiring by what right we hold him in the disagreeable duress
of dry legal detail.


In returning to Henry, we find him offering to act as mediator
between Charles of France and the Duke of Bretagne, when, like
every meddler in the disputes of others, he is unable to emerge from
the position in which he has placed himself, without that nasal tweak
which is the due reward of impertinence. The taxes he was obliged
to impose for the purpose of interference, undertaken, as he alleged,
to curb the ambition of the French court, were very exorbitant
and particularly so on account of Henry's avarice, which induced him
to put about ten per cent, of every levy into his own pocket. The
people were, of course, dissatisfied, and the harshness used in
collecting the subsidy irritated them so much in the north, that they took
their change out of the unfortunate Duke of Northumberland, whom
they killed, because he had the ill luck to be employed in the invidious
office of tax-gatherer.


In 1490 parliament liberally granted some more money to carry on
the war with France, but Henry pocketed the cash, and sent some
priests to try and compromise the matter with the enemy. It was not
until four years afterwards, in the course of 1494, that he really went
to work against the French, but he contrived to make it pay him
exceedingly well; for he not only grabbed the subsidies voted for the
purpose, but he converted them into so much clear profit, by getting
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 9 -->
his knights and nobles to bear their own expenses out of their own
pockets. He kindly gave them permission to sell their estates
without the ordinary fines; and many a gallant fellow sold
himself completely up, in the hope of indemnifying himself by what he
should be able to take from the French in battle.


Henry had, however, completely humbugged his gallant knights
and nobles; for he never intended them to have the chance of
gaining anything in France by conquest, and had, in fact, settled
the whole matter at a very early period. He had made up his mind
not to spend more than he could help, and had been putting away
the subsidies in a couple of huge portmanteaus, which served him
for coffers. Under the pretence of doing something, he passed over
with his army to France, and " sat down " before Boulogne, but his
sitting down proved that he had no intention of making any stand,
and a truce was very soon agreed upon. Two treaties were drawn
up, one of which was to be made public, for the purpose of
misleading the people, and the other was a private transaction between
the two sovereigns. The first only stipulated for peace, but the
second secured the sum of to be paid by instalments to
Henry, who must have been under the necessity of ordering
another coffer to receive the additional wealth that was thus
poured in upon him.


Xew troubles were, however, commencing to disturb the mind
of the king, who received one morning at breakfast, a despatch
announcing the arrival, at the Cove of Cork, of another pretender
to the Crown of England. " There seems to be no end to these
vagabonds," he mentally exclaimed, as he read the document
announcing that a handsome young man had been giving himself out
as Richard Duke of York, second son of Edward IV., and legitimate
heir to the monarchy. " Pooh, pooh," ejaculated Henry, " the
fellow was disposed of in the Tower long ago;" but on perusing
further he found that the young man had met this objection by
alleging that he had escaped, and had been for seven years a
wanderer. It was exceedingly improbable that the royal youth had
been so long upon the tramp; but his story was not very rigidly
criticised by Henry's enemies. The wanderer introduced himself to  
  
  
  VOL. 11. c
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 10 -->
the Duchess of Burgundy, who, after some inquiry, pronounced him
to be genuine, and embraced him as the undoubted son of her dear
brother Edward. She gave him the poetical name of the White
Rose of England; but Henry knowing that " the rose by any other
name" would not "smell as sweet" in the nostrils of the English,
gave out that the "White Rose" was a Jew boy of the name ot
Peterkin or Perkin Warbeck. It was further alleged that the lad
had been recently a footman in the family of Lady Brompton, with
whom he had been travelling. Peterkin was materially damaged
in public opinion by getting the character of a mere " flunky," and
he was afraid to do more than hover about the coast without
venturing to effect a landing. Though Henry had held the
Pretender up to ridicule, Perkin Warbeck's opposition was in reality no
joke, and the king bribed a few of the party to betray their colleagues.
Several were at once informed against, among whom were the two
Ratcliffes, who denied their guilt in the usual Ratcliffe highway: but
their repudiation had no effect, for one of them was at once beheaded.
Sir William Stanley, a very old friend of the Richmond family,
whose brother, Lord Stanley, had put the battered crown on Henry's
brow in the field of Bosworth, became an object of suspicion; and
thinking he should get off by a confession, he acknowledged
everything he had been guilty of, with a supplement containing a
catalogue of offences he had never committed. Thus by denying too
much for confession and owning enough for condemnation, he fell
between two stools—one of which was the stool of repentance—and
lost his head at the moment he fancied he was upon a safe footing.


The party of Perkin Warbeck being discouraged by these events,
and the people of Flanders having grown tired of the Pretender's
long visit, he felt that "now or never" was the time for his descent
on England. The White Rose having torn himself away by the
force of sheer pluck, attempted to transplant himself to the coast of
Deal, but he found a Kentish knight ready to repel the Rose, and
by a cry of " Go it, my tulips," encouraging his followers to resist all
oppression. The White Rose and his companions mournfully took
their leaves, and as many as could escape returned with press of sail
to Flanders. Henry sent a vote of thanks to the men of Kent with
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 11 -->
a promise of gold, but the remittance never came to hand from that
day to the present.


Mr. P. Warbeck was now becoming such a nuisance in ETanders,
that he was told he must really suit himself with another situation
immediately. He tried Ireland, but the dry announcement of " no
such person known," was almost the only answer to his overtures.
As a last resource, and a proof of the desperate nature of his fortune,
he actually threw himself upon the generosity of the Scotch, which
was almost as hopeless as running his head against a stone wall;
but as it was just possible that Perkin Warbeck might be turned to
profitable account against England, the Scotch opened their hearts
—where there is never any admission except on business—to the
adventurous wanderer. James III., king of Scotland, chiefly out of
spite to Henry, not only received Perkin as the genuine Duke of
York, but married him to Lady Catherine Gordon, the lovely and
accomplished daughter of the Earl of Huntley, a relative of the
royal house of Stuart. An agreement was drawn up between James
of Scotland of the one part, and Perkin Warbeck of the other, by
virtue of which Perkin was to be pitchforked on to the English
throne, and was to make over the town of Berwick-on-Tweed—when
he got it—as an acknowledgment to King James for his valuable
services. After some little delay, the Scotch crossed the border to
enforce Perkin's demand; but when that individual arrived in England,
he found himself so thoroughly snubbed that he sneaked back again.


Notwithstanding the utter failure of this enterprise, which had
cost Henry not a penny to resist, he sent in a bill as long as his arm
for the equipment of his army. The people, who had not been called
upon to strike a single blow, and always liked to have, what they
called, " their whack for their money," were enraged at being asked
to pay for a battle that had never happened. The men of Cornwall
were particularly angry at having to give any of their tin, and came
up to Blackheath, under Lord Audley, whose inexperience was so
great that he might have furnished the original for the sign of the
\"Green Man," which so long remained the distinguishing feature of
the neighbourhood. The battle of Blackheath was fought on the
22nd of June, 1497, with a good deal of superfluous strength on one
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 12 -->
side, and consummate bad management on the other. On the
side of the insurgents, one Flammock or Flummock, an attorney,
was a principal leader, but he would gladly have taken out a
summons to stay proceedings, had such practice been allowable. It is
probable that this "gentleman one, &c." had been persuaded by  
  
  
  Perkin Warbeck and his Army.

some noble client who had an interest in the fight to appear as his
attorney in this memorable action.


Henry having gained every advantage in his recent transactions,
was desirous of completing his arrangements, by purchasing
Warbeck, it any one could be found base enough to sell that
unfortunate individual. James of Scotland was too honourable for
such a shameful bargain, though he was greatly embarrassed in
assisting Warbeck, for whom he had melted down his plate—an act
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P32_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 13 -->
worthy of the most fiddle-headed spoon—besides raising money on a
gold chain he used to wear, and to which he was so attached,
that he compared it to  
  
  
  " Linked sweetness long drawn out,"

as he drew it forth from his pocket to put it into the hands of
the pawnbroker.


It was now intimated to Perkin Warbeck that he " had better go,"
for his presence had become exceedingly costly and embarrassing.
\"I've nothing more for you, my good man," were the considerate
words of James as he despatched his guest to seek his fortune
elsewhere, attended by a few trusty retainers, who stuck to him
\"through thick and thin," an attachment which, as he could hardly
pay his own way, must have been very embarrassing. His wife's
fidelity to him in his ill-fortune was a beautiful as well as a
gratifying fact, for she had, really, seen much better days, and the
sacrifices she made in sharing the fate of a Pretender " out of luck"
were quite undeniable.


Perkin Warbeck made first for Cork in the hope of raising the
Irish, but as he could not raise the Spanish, the former would have
nothing to do with him. He next tried Cornwall, and marching
inland he soon found himself at the head of a party of discontented
ragamuffins, who happened to be ready for a row, without any
ulterior views of a very definite character. He called himself
Richard IV., and penetrated into England as far as Taunton Dean,
where Henry's forces had already collected. Warbeck was admirable
in all his preliminary arrangements, and it was " quite a picture " to
see him reviewing his troops; but, picture as he was, the idea of
fighting put him into such a fright, that he always lost his colour.
He was first-rate on parade, but quite unequal to the business of a
battle, and, indeed, to use an illustration founded on a fact of our own
times, he would have been invaluable in the Astley's version of
Waterloo, though utterly contemptible in the original performance
of that tremendous action.


No sooner had Perkin Warbeck ascertained the propinquity of
the enemy than he recommended that his forces should all go to bed
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 14 -->
in good time to be fresh for action early in the morning. Having
first ascertained that all were asleep, he stole off to the stable,
saddled his horse, and having mounted the poor brute, stuck spurs
into its side until he reached the sanctuary of Beaulieu in the New
Forest. When this disgraceful desertion of their leader wasdisHenry VII. end Perkin Warbeok's Wife.

covered the rebels set up a piteous howl and threw themselves on
the mercy of Henry, who ordered some to hang, and sent others to
starve, by dismissing them without food or clothing. Lady Catherine
Gordon, alias Mrs. P. Warbeck, who had been sojourning for safety
at St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, was brought before the King,
who, touched by her beauty and her tears, experienced in his heart

<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 15 -->
that truly English sentiment which declares, that " the man who
would basely injure a lovely woman, in distress, is unworthy of the
name of a—a—British officer." He therefore sent her on a visit to
the Queen, who paid every attention to the fallen heroine.  
  
  
  
Perkin Warbeck Reading his Confession.


The next thing to be done was to rout Perkin Warbeck out of the
hole into which cowardice had driven him. Henry was unwilling to
disturb the sanctuary, but he sent his agents to parley with Perkin,
who, finding himself regularly hemmed in, thought it better to come
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P35_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 16 -->
out on the best terms he could, and he accordingly emerged on the
promise of a pardon. Henry was anxious to get a peep at the
individual who had caused so much trouble, but thought it infra dig. to
admit the rebel into the royal presence. The king, therefore,
reverted to his old practice of getting behind a screen, an article he
must have carried about with him wherever he went, that he might,
unseen, indulge his curiosity. This paltry practice should have
obtained for him the name of Peeping Harry, for we find him, at
more than one period of his reign, skulking behind a screen, in the
most ignoble manner. Perkin was made to ride up to London
behind Henry, at a little distance, and on getting to town he was sent
on horseback through Cheapside and Cornhill, as a show for the
citizens. There were the usual demonstrations of popular criticism
on this occasion, and there is no doubt that amid the gibes and scoffs
addressed to the captive the significant interrogatory of " Who ran
away from Taunton Dean \" was not forgotten.


After taking a turn to the Tower and back for the
accommodation of the inhabitants at the East End, who desired to be gratified
with a sight of the Pretender, Perkin was lodged in the palace at
Westminster, where a good deal of liberty seems to have been
allowed him. He however chose to run away, and being caught
again, he was made to stand in the stocks a whole day before the
door of Westminster Hall, where he was made to read a written
confession which was interrupted by an occasional egg in his eye,
or cabbage-leaf over his mouth, for such are the voluntary
contributions which a British public has always been ready to offer to
helpless impotence.


The next day the same ceremony with the same accessories was
repeated at Cheapside, in order to give the East End an opportunity
of enjoying the sport, which the West End had already revelled in.
Perkin Warbeck was then committed to the Tower, where he and
the unfortunate Earl of Warwick became what may be termed fast
friends, for they were bound tightly together in the same prison.
Warbeck, who was in every sense of the word an accomplished
swindler, succeeded in winning the good opinion, not only of his
fellow-captive, but of the keepers of the jail, three of whom, it is
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 17 -->
said, had actually undertaken to murder Sir John Digby, the
governor, for the sake of getting hold of the keys, and releasing the
two captives. It was now evident that Warbeck would never be
quiet, and Henry, feeling him to be a troublesome fellow, determined
to get rid of him. On the 16th of November, 1499, Warbeck was
arraigned at Westminster Hall, and being found guilty as a matter
of course, was executed on the 23rd of the same month at Tyburn,
where, cowardly to the last, he asked the forgiveness of the king,
even on the scaffold.


Walpole, in his "Historic Doubts"—a work that throws
everything into uncertainty and settles nothing—gives it as his opinion
that Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York; but had
Walpole been able to tell " a sheep's head from a carrot," he would
never have been guilty of such a piece of confounding and
confounded blundering. We who give no encouragement whatever to
Historic Doubts are tolerably sure that Perkin Warbeck was merely
a fashionable swindler, for he had none of that personal courage or
true dignity which would have redeemed his imposture from the
character of mere quackery. He contrived to ruin poor Warwick, or
at all events to hasten his destruction by implicating him in a
conspiracy, which of his own accord he never would have dreamed of.


When put upon his trial, the hapless earl—who, though only
twenty-nine years of age, was from long seclusion in a state of second
childhood, if indeed he had ever got out of his first —confessed with
piteous simplicity all that had been alleged against him. He was
beheaded on Tower Hill the 24th* of November, 1499; and it was
said that his death was the most merciful that could be conceived,
for in losing his head he was deprived of that which he never knew
how to use, and of the possession of which he did not at any time
seem sensible. Warbeck's widow continued to go by the name of
the White Rose, when Sir Matthew Cradoc, thinking it a pity that


* Hume says the 21st. Another authority says the 28th. It is not with a mere
wish to "split the difference" that we adopt the medium date of the 24th, but we
have good reasons for stating that to be the exact day, and Mr. Charles Macfarlane,
in his admirable " Cabinet History of England" has likewise named the 24th of
November as the precise time of Warwick's execution.  
  
  
  VOL. II. L)
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 18 -->
she should be "left blooming alone," offered to graft her on his
family tree, and the White Rose consented to this arrangement.


Henry had long been anxious to marry his daughter Margaret to
James of Scotland, and he sent a cunning bishop, most appropriately
named Fox, to act the part of a match-maker. The sly old dog
brought the matter so cleverly about that the marriage was agreed
upon, and this union led to the peaceful union of the two countries
about a century afterwards. The young lady got but a small portion
from her stingy father, and her husband made a settlement upon her
of;£2,000 a year, but he got her to accept a paltry compromise.
The meanness of the arrangements may be judged of by the
ridiculous fact that king James and his young bride rode into Edinburgh
on the same palfrey.


Henry's eldest son, Arthur Prince of Wales, had been already
married to Catherine, fourth daughter of Ferdinand of Spain, who
promised 200,000 crowns, half of which he paid down, as a wedding
portion. The young husband died soon after, and Ferdinand
naturally asked for his money and his child back again. The
English king had pocketed the greater part of the cash, which he
was not only quite unwilling to refund, but he had serious thoughts
of proceeding for the balance of his daughter-in-law's dowry. He
therefore consented to affiance her to his second son, Henry, in
compliance with the only condition upon which Ferdinand agreed to
waive his claim to the cash already in hand, and he even promised
to pay the rest of the portion at his " earliest convenience."


Henry himself, or as we may call him for the sake of distinction,
the " old gentleman," had lately lost his wife, and he went at once
into the matrimonial market to see whether there was anything upon
which it might be safe to speculate. He however wanted to conduct
his operations with such extraordinary profit to himself that nothing
seemed to tempt his avarice. His ruling passion was for " cash
down," and to obtain this he fleeced his subjects most unmercifully,
though he employed the disreputable firm of Empson and Dudley to
collect the amount of the various extortions he was continually
practising. These two men were little better than swindlers, though
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 19 -->
as lawyers they adhered to the rules of law, and indeed they kept
a rabble always in the house to sit as jurymen. They had trials
in their own office, and would often ring the bell to order up a jury
from down stairs, just as anyone in the present day wrjuld order up
his dinner. Dudley got the name of the Leech, from his power of
drawing, and indeed he would have got the blood out of a
bloodstone if the opportunity had been afforded him.*


Henry had now but one formidable enemy left, in the person
of young Edmund de la Pole, the nephew of Edward IV., and son
and heir to the Duke of Suffolk. This turbulent individual renewed
the cry in favour of the "White Rose," which was said by a wag
of the day to be raised on a pole, after the fashion of the
frozenout gardeners.


Suffolk soon had the mortification of finding that he had not the
suffrages of the people, for the rush to the Pole was anything but
encouraging. " Ye Pole theyreforre " says Comines, " dydde cutte
hys stycke" and became a penniless fugitive in Flanders. He was
ultimately surrendered by Philip, the archduke who had received
Suffolk as a visitor, but gave him up with a lot of sundries he
was transferring to Henry, who promised to spare the prisoner's life,
and did so, though he left word in his will that his successor had
better kill the earl as he would otherwise prove troublesome.


In the course of the year 1509, Henry's health became very
indifferent, and he had repeated attacks of the gout, everyone of which
put him in ill-humour with himself in particular, and the world in
general. Every fresh twinge was paid with interest upon one or
more of his unfortunate subjects; and when he got very bad he
would be most indiscriminate in his cruelty. He fixed upon a poor
old alderman named Harris, who died of sheer vexation at his
illtreatment before his indictment came on; and at this remote period
we hope we shall not be accused of injuring the feelings of any of the


* Empson has been described by Hume as a man of "mean birth and brutal
temper," who of course did all the bullying of this disreputable firm, while Dudley,
who was " better born, better educated, and better bred," acted in the capacity of
what may be termed the decoy duck of the concern; or, in other words, the latter
snared the game which the former savagely butchered.
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 20 -->
posterity of poor Harris by saying, that he was literally harassed to
death through the unkindness of his sovereign. During his illness
Henry would do justice occasionally between man and man, but a
favourable turn in his malady, a quiet night, or a refreshing nap,
would bury all his good resolutions in oblivion. At length on the
night of the 21st of April, 1509, he died at Richmond, leaving behind
him a will in which he bequeathed to his son and heir, the delightful
task of repairing all his father's errors.


However easy it may be for an executor to pay the pecuniary
debts of a testator with plenty of assets in hand, the moral
responsibilities which have been left unsatisfied, are not so soon provided for.
It is true that a good son frequently makes atonement to society for
the mischief done by a bad parent; but this, though it strikes a sort
of balance with the world, does not prevent the father from being
still held accountable for his deficiencies.


Henry died in the fifty-third year of his age, and had he lived a
day longer, he would have reigned twenty-three years and eight
months, or as Cocker has it, in the simplicity of his heart, " had he
been alive in the year 1700, he would have reigned upwards of two
centuries." Our business, however, is not with what he might have
done, but what he actually did, and we therefore record the fact, that
he died April 21st, 1509, and was buried in the magnificent chapel of
Westminster Abbey which he built, and which is called after him to
this very day and hour that we now write upon.*


It is often the most painful part of our labours to give characters
of some of the sovereigns who pass under our review in the course of
this history. To those who have only known Henry VII. as the
chivalrous and high-minded prince that fought so gallantly with
Richard III. on the field of Bosworth, it will be distressing to hear
that the Richmond of their dramatic recollections is nothing like a
true portrait of the actual character. At all events, if he had virtues
in his youth they were not made to wear, for they became sufficiently
threadbare to be seen through before he had been a single month an  
  
  
  * A quarter to one, A.M., April 13th, 1847.
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 21 -->
occupant of the throne of England. Even his ambition seems to have
been little more than a medium he had adopted for gratifying his
avarice, and it is now pretty clear that he rather wanted the crown
for what it was worth in a pecuniary point of view, than for the
honourable gratification which power when rightly used is capable
of conferring on its possessor. Hume tells us that " Henry loved
peace without fearing war," which is true enough : for war afforded
him a pretext for raising money, while peace, which he generally
managed to arrange, gave him an opportunity of pocketing the cash
he had collected. War, therefore, was never formidable to him, for
he usually manœuvred to keep out of it; but he made the rumour of
it serve as an excuse for taxing his people. He was decidedly clever
as a practical man, though exceedingly unprincipled, but several
salutary laws were passed in his reign: one of the best of which was
an act allowing the poor to sue in forma pauper is. Considering how
often the law reduces its suitors to poverty, it is only fair that those
who are brought to such a condition should still be allowed to go on,
for it is like ruining a man and then turning him out of doors to say
that the courts shall be closed against such as are penniless.


Another important and useful measure of Henry's reign was that
by which the nobility and gentry could alienate their estates, or cut
off the tail, which limited everything to the head of a family. This
apparently liberal act was passed for the benefit of the king himself,
who wished his nobles to be able to sell everything they had got for
the sake of paying the expenses of the wars, which otherwise must
have been prosecuted partly out of Henry's own pocket. He owed
more to fortune than to his own merit, and even the conspiracies
that were got up against him from time to time helped to sustain
him in his high position, as the shuttlecock is kept in a state of
elevation by constant blows from the battledore.

Nothing could exceed the grossness of the adulation which was
poured out upon him at his accession, and the perfection of the art of
puffing in England, may, perhaps, be ascribed to this period of our
history. His countenance was likened to that of Apollo—a falsehood
for which, in his features, no apolo—gy can be found : his chest was
declared to be that of Mars, though it was evidently his Pa's, for in

<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 23 -->
early youth his resemblance to his father was remarkable. Clemency
was declared to be seated on his ample forehead, Equity was
pronounced to be balancing itself on the bridge of his nose, Intelligence
was recognised lurking in ambush among his bushy hair; and even
Erasmus attributes to him the acuteness of the needle, with other
intellectual qualities of an exalted character.*


It is sad to reflect that the philosopher, when he takes the
paintbrush in hand to dash off the portrait of a king, is apt to become a
mere parasite, and will not abstain from staining his own character
by daubing with false colours the canvas of history. Thus, even
Erasmus used hues his friends would be glad to erase, and has
covered over the black spots in Henry's character, with that pink of
perfection which makes coulcur de rose of everything. It is not to be
wondered at, that in setting out upon the voyage of government
Henry received " one turn-a-head "—if we may be allowed a
nautical expression—while the engines of flattery were at work
on all sides of him. It is to be regretted, for the sake of himself
as well as for the good of his subjects, that truth was not at hand to
give him that friendly "shove astern " which has saved many from
precipitating themselves on the rocks that always lie in the course of
greatness and power.


As if determined to begin as he intended to go on, Henry looked
out at once for a wife, and, considering how often he was destined to
undergo the marriage ceremony in the course of his reign, it was as
well that he should lose no time in commencing the career that lay
before him. In his first matrimonial adventure he appears to have let
others choose for him, instead of making a selection for himself, and
Catherine of Aragon, the widow of his elder brother, Arthur, was
pointed out to him as an eligible parti for nuptial purposes.


This marriage was strongly recommended by the political faculty,
as a saving of expense, for the lady would have been entitled to a
large pension as widow of Prince Arthur; and her friends in Spain,
had she been returned upon their hands, would have wanted to know


* We are indebted to Mr. Tytler, who is generally correct to a tittle, for these
interesting particulars.—See his Life of Henry VIII., p. 16 of the 2nd Edition.
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 24 -->
something about the 150,000 crowns she had received as a marriage
portion. Of course the whole of it was gone, and it was thought that
Henry would be killing a whole covey of birds with one stone, if he
would consent to take her as his wife, inasmuch as he would thus
extinguish her claims to a pension, and prevent any awkward
questions being asked in Spain as to the portion she had brought with
her to England. Henry feeling a sort of intuitive consciousness that
he should have plenty of opportunities to select a wife for himself,
agreed to take, as a beginning, the one that had been chosen for him
by others, and accordingly, on the 3rd of June, 1509, the lady, who
was eight years older than himself, became his wife, at Greenwich.
The royal couple were not destined to roll down the hill together in
after life, whatever they may have done on the day of their union,
which was doubtless marked by all those sports of which the locality
was susceptible. Catherine, though a little passe'e, looked
exceedingly well, for, in order to render her appearance more attractive, she
was dressed in white, and " all Greenwich," says Lord Herbert, " did
not, on that day, contain a daintier dish of white bait than the Lady
of Aragon." The royal pair were crowned on the 24th of June, 1509,
being exactly three weeks after marriage, up to which period, at
least, there was no indication of that Bluebeardism which
subsequently broke out with so much fury in the royal character.


Henry had on his accession thrown himself into the arms of his
grandmother, the old Countess of Richmond, upon whose advice he
acted in the selection of his ministers. The old lady died in the
same month in which her grandson was married and crowned, at
the respectable age of sixty-eight; and it is a curious fact that she
had been married three times, so that in his multiplicity of wives,
Henry VIII. may be said to have simply improved upon the example
set him by his gi andmother.*


The first political act of Henry the Eighth's reign, was to lay the
heads of Empson and Dudley upon the scaffold. These rapacious
extortioners had been the tools of his father's avarice, but hadcon
* Her friend and Counsellor, Jack Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, says of her, that "a

<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 25 -->
trived to feather their own nests tolerably well; and Henry kept
them in prison for the purpose of getting out of them the wealth
they had acquired by their rapacity. He detained them in the
Tower a whole year before he beheaded them, and continued to
squeeze out of them everything they possessed, for he was one of
those who never threw an orange away without thoroughly sucking

it. Having drained it at length completely dry by about the 17th of
August, 1510, he, on that day—to pursue the allegory of the orange
—declined allowing them any quarter, but sent them to Tower Hill,
where execution was done upon both of them.


Henry, finding everything going smoothly in England, fell into
the common error of those who, having every comfort at home, must
needs look abroad for the elements of discord. He entered into a
league against Louis XII. of France, in favour of Pope Julius II.  
  
  
  VOL. II.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P45_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 26 -->
and his father-in-law, Ferdinand of Aragon; but the latter kept
helping himself to large slices of territory, and made use of his allies
for the purpose of furthering his own interests. Henry's troops
were therefore compelled to play an ignoble part, being cooped up
in a French town, while the other soldiers overran Navarre, and
appropriated everything they could lay their hands upon. Amazed
at their moderate success upon land they attempted to retrieve
themselves by a sea-fight, but the ruler was not then found by which
Britannia subsequently learned to rule the waves, and the French
fleet escaping into Brest found shelter in their country's bosom.


In 1513, Henry being anxious to obtain ascendancy over the
seas, appointed Sir Edward Howard, one of the sons of the Earl of
Surrey, to accomplish the grand object. Howard was so exceedingly
confident of success that he sent a private note requesting the king to
come and see how beautifully he (Howard) would " spifflicate "—for
such was the word—the presumptuous enemy. Henry by no means
relished the invitation, and replied to it by desiring Howard to
"mind his own business" as admiral. This nettled the naval
commander, who, during the engagement, jumped into one of the
enemy's ships, and could not jump back again; while Sir John
Wallop, upon whom he had relied, exhibited little of that usefulness
which his name seems to indicate. Poor Howard was, accordingly,
killed; and Henry, flattered by his parasites, came to the resolution
that no good would be done till he himself set out for France at
the head of an army.


In a few days he arrived off Boulogne, where he instructed the
artillery to make as much noise as they could with their guns, in
order that he might intimidate the foe, and encourage himself by the
roaring of his own cannon. His object was undoubtedly to insinuate
to the enemy, " We are coming in tremendous force, and so you had
better keep out of our way, for fear of accidents."


Henry, who had various other great guns on board besides his
artillery, was accompanied by Thomas Wolsey, his almoner, lately
risen into favour, together with the celebrated Bishop Fox, and a
number of courtiers. He passed his time very pleasantly at Calais
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 27 -->
for about three months, when he heard that the celebrated Bayard—
the elicvalier sans peur et sans rcprochc—was moving forward. The
English king bounded on to his horse with the elasticity of Indian
rubber, and advanced at the head of fifteen thousand men—Bishop
Fox, with characteristic cunning, keeping in the rear, and Wolsey
following the Fox at a prudent distance.  
  
  
  Henry's Ten


Twelve hundred French approached under the cover of a regular
English fog, which with a most anti-national spirit favoured the
enemies of the country to which it owed its origin. Bayard would
have commenced an attack, but he was overruled by some of his
companions; and Henry, thinking the foe afraid to " come on,"
sat himself down in a pavilion made of silk damask, foolishly
believing that the art of the upholsterer could uphold the dignity
of a sovereign.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P47_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 28 -->

Thus he sat, like the proprietor of a gingerbread stall at a fair,
until a terrific shower came on, and the silk streamers were streaming
with wet, and the satin chairs could no longer be sat-in with comfort
or convenience. The tent was turned, literally, inside out by the
wind, like an umbrella in a storm, and Henry was glad to exchange
his gaudy booth for a substantial wooden caravan, that was speedily
knocked together for his reception. Though the two armies did not
fight they commenced operations by mining and countermining, but
instead of making receptacles for gunpowder they were only making
gutters for the rain, which took advantage of every opening. The
Count of Angouleme (afterwards Francis I.) now arrived at
headquarters, and scoured the country, which he wras the better able to
do from the quantity of water which had fallen on many parts of it.


Henry now received a visit from the Emperor Maximilian, and
the English king made the most magnificent preparations for the
interview; he equipped himself and some of his nobles in gold and
silver tissue—though it is said the latter wore a tissue of falsehoods,
for their finery was all sham—and he borrowed every bit of jewellery
in his camp for his own personal bedizenment. He had a garniture
of garnets in his hat, and even his watch, a tremendous turnip, had
a diamond, weighing several carats, on its face, while a magnificent
ruby matched with the rubicundity of his forehead, over which the
gem was gracefully disposed. The nobles were sprinkled all over
with paste, and looked effective enough at the price which Henry
had given for their embellishment. Maximilian, who was in
mourning, presented a dismal contrast to all this finery, for he wore
nothing but a suit of serge, which, however, turned out far more
serviceable than the fancy costume of Henry and his courtiers. The
rain came on so furiously that unless the silks were washing silks
they must have been fearfully damaged by the wet, while the running
of the hues one into the other caused Henry's party to come off
with—in one sense—flying colours. It was at length determined to
make an attack upon the French, and the Emperor Maximilian
having got his old serge doublet trimmed up with a red cross, and
pinned an artificial flower in his hat, directed the operations of
the English. The French cavalry began pretty well; but whether
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 29 -->
Maximilian looked so great a Guy as to terrify the horses, or through
any other cause, it is certain that a panic ran through the ranks,
and they commenced a retreat at full gallop, using their spurs with
tremendous vehemence.


One of the fugitives, a venerable Marshal, broke his baton in
beating a retreat over the back of his charger; and Bayard, who
had refused to run, seeing the baton of his comrade broken,
exclaimed, "Ha! he has cut his stick!" which afterwards became a
by-word to describe the act of a fugitive. The illustrious Chevalier
sans pcur et sans rcproche became a prisoner, but thoroughly enjoyed
the joke of his countrymen having run away, and laughingly called
it the battle of the spurs, from the energy with which they had
plunged their rowels into the flanks of their chargers.


A meeting between Bayard, Maximilian, and Henry, has been
described very graphically in the Histoire de Bon Chevalier; * and it
appears from this authority that the two latter bantered their prisoner
in a somewhat uncourteous manner. Bayard contended that he had
become captive by a voluntary surrender; upon which the emperor
and the king burst out into a fit of rude laughter, as if they would
have said, " That's a capital joke; " but Bayard protested that he
might have got away had he chosen to run for it. They only replied
to him by saying, " Well, well, my fine fellow, we've got you, and it
matters little whether you took yourself into custody, or how else
you came here; but here you unquestionably are, and there's an end
of the discussion."


After taking Tournay, where he held a number of tournaments,
and which was actually sacrificed by the inhabitants for the sake of
a bad pun f—worse even than the accidental one in the text—
Henry returned to England, and arrived on the 24th of October,
1513, at Richmond.


Thus ended the expedition to France; but important events had
been happening at home, for the Earl of Surrey had been chevying


* Vol. ii., page 80.

citizens : " Que Tournay n'avoit jamais tourne" ni encore ne tournerail."
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 30 -->
the Scotch over the Cheviot Hills, and at last fought them at
Flodden, where James IV. unfortunately fell; and the English queen,
making a parcel of his coat, hat, and gloves, sent them to Henry as
a proof of the dressing the Scotch had experienced.


It had been intended to resume the war with France, but Louis
XII. suggested a compromise, by which he married Mary, the sister
of the English king, and Mary thus had the honour of mollifying the
asperity of the feelings that the two monarchs had hitherto indulged.


We have already mentioned the name of Wolsey, who
accompanied Henry abroad in the capacity of almoner; and it is now time
that we give some particulars of a person who played one of the most
important parts in the drama of history.


Thomas Wolsey was born at Ipswich, in March, 1471, of humble
parents; but the popular story of his father having been a butcher is
probably a fable, to which the fact of his having had a stake in the
country has perhaps given some likelihood. It is doubtful whether
he was brought up to the block, though he might have been obliged
to give his head to it at a later period of his life, when he incurred
his master's displeasure. It has been said that Wolsey senior could
not have been a butcher, because he left money to his son by will;
but business must have been bad indeed if he could not bequeath a
couple of legacies of thirteen-and-fourpence each, with one of
sixand-sevenpence, and another of eleven shillings, in addition to a sum
of ten marks, which constitute altogether the entire amount of cash
that was actually disposed of by the old gentleman to his wife, his
son, and his executors.* If the elder Wolsey was really a butcher, it
is certain that he had not a sharper blade in his establishment than
his son Tom, who was sent early to school, and having proceeded to
the University of Oxford, got on so well as to acquire the name of
the Boy Bachelor. He soon became a fellow, and was one of the
cleverest young fellows in the College, where he was intrusted to
educate the three sons of the Duke of Dorset. In this capacity, by
the application of a great deal of flattery—or, as some would have
termed it, Dorset Butter—while at home with the young gentlemen  
  
  
  * His will was published by Dr. Fiddes, from the Registry at Norwich.
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 31 -->
for the Christmas holidays, he got the patronage of their noble
father, who presented him with the rectory of Lymington. Here he
is said to have disgraced himself by getting into a row at a fair, but
we can scarcely believe that the clergyman of the parish would have
forgotten himself so far as to give his love of gaiety full swing, and
allow him to carry absurdity to the height which such a proceeding
seems to indicate. He could not have very far compromised his
character, or he would not have been employed by Henry VIE, on
delicate and important missions which a parson fresh from " the fun
of the fair" would never have been allowed to execute. Some of his
detractors have broadly asserted that Wolsey was inebriated, and
fled in shame from his cure, but we really believe that he was never
at any period of his life intoxicated with anything but ambition,
which undoubtedly is quicker in turning the head than the strongest
juice that ever dropped from the ripest juniper. Fox, the Bishop of
Winchester, strongly recommended Wolsey to Henry VIII., who,
already knowing something of the young man, made him King's
Almoner; and on taking Tournay, in France, hesitated whether he
should burn it down, or make Wolsey its bishop. The latter of the
two evils fell upon the town, which was placed under the ambitious
churchman's ecclesiastical cognizance. He rose rapidly to the sees
of Lincoln and York, became Lord High Chancellor of England, and
on the 7th of September, 1515, received his crowning honour, in the
hat of a cardinal.


We must now put Wolsey by for a little bit, though we shall have
to bring him out again and again, for we must not keep others
waiting by lingering too long in the accomplished churchman's
company. We left the princess Mary just married to Louis XII.,
though her heart had long been given to Charles Brandon, Viscount
Lisle, who retained the principal of her affections, though the French
king got for a time the interest. He however enjoyed it for only
two months, when he died, and Brandon, the remainder-man,
became the tenant in possession, by marrying Mary after three months'
widowhood. Henry was at first very angry with the match, but the
young couple rushing into his presence like two repentant lovers in
a farce, and Wolsey interceding with all the air of the " smart
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 32 -->
servant," the king was persuaded to give that cheapest of all
donations—his blessing. Brandon's good sense and modesty went
some way in reconciling Henry, for Viscount Lisle never ■
presumed upon his connection with the family of royalty. He did
not talk continually of " My brother-in-law the king," as he might
have done; but he took the following motto, in which there is a
strong indication of his "knowing his place," and being determined
on keeping it.  
  
  
  " Cloth of gold do not despise,
Though thou be match'd with cloth of frize;

Cloth of frize be not too bold,

Though thou be match'd with cloth of gold."*


Francis I. had succeeded to the French throne, and the Archduke
Charles of Austria had come in for the whole of the Spanish
monarchy by the death of his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand of Aragon.
He was a maternal grandfather in a double sense, for he had grown
very old-womanish, and the adjective maternal was by no means
inappropriate. Francis and Charles became competitors for the empire
just vacant by the death of Maximilian, and the countenance of
Henry was eagerly sought by both of the disputants. Henry had
formerly hoped to have been himself a successful candidate, but
finding he had no chance, he wrote to Charles, saying he " wished
he might get it," which were the genuine sentiments no doubt of the
English sovereign. The election fell upon Charles, and Francis
affected to take the consequence as if it had been of no consequence
at all, though it was clearly otherwise.


The election for the rank and dignity of Emperor was one of the
most disgracefully corrupt proceedings that was ever witnessed, even
in the palmiest days of the boroughmongering system in England,
some centuries afterwards. The candidates were Francis I. of
France, Charles V., King of Castile, Henry VIII. of England, and
the Elector Frederic of Saxony. The bribery was on a scale of
vastness never before heard of, and it is said that Charles scattered his—
or his people's—money among the independent electors withfright* "Granger's Biog. Hist.," vol. i., p. 82.
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 33 -->
ful prodigality. The electors of Cologne, which was not then in such
good odour as might have been expected from the pleasant purity of
its Eau, pocketed no less than 200,000 crowns; but the mother of
Francis I. declared, that " the electors, among them all, had not

received from the king, her son, more than 100,000 crowns,"* so that
the loss of his election is very easily accounted for. Francis,
nevertheless, imagined he had secured five electors out of the seven; but
these worthies, who were dishonestly receiving bribes from both
parties at once, eventually gave to Charles, who paid them best, the  
  
  
  * Ellis's Letters, vol. i., p. 155.

<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 34 -->
benefit of their suffrages. Poor Saxony, expecting in a contest with
such powerful opponents that he might get " double milled," resigned
in favour of Charles; and Henry, whose committee had been sitting
to conduct his election, until it was clear there would be nothing to
conduct, threw his influence into the same scale.


On the 28th of June, 1519, the polling commenced, and each
elector as he came up to give his vote was, no doubt, received with
the shouts and salutations that are usual on all similar occasions.
When the Elector of Cologne appeared to plump for Charles, after
having quite as plumply promised his support to Francis, the jeers of
the populace were tremendous, and an egg was even thrown for the
purpose of egging on the crowd to acts of violence. The
unprincipled elector looked contemptuously on the oval missile, as if he
would have said that he did not care about submitting to the
yolk, after the extensive " shelling out" that had already taken place
for his benefit.


The countenance of Henry was still the object of both their
wishes, and Francis asked the English king for an interview, which
was arranged to take place in France in the ensuing summer. Upon
the appointment having been made, Charles ran over to England to
be the first to get Henry's ear, and seeing Wolsey's influence, did
his utmost to win over that wary individual. The latter secretly
aspired to the papal chair, and it may perhaps be said that his origin
is proved to have been that of a butcher's son, because he began to
look at everything with a pope's eye, and hoped to eat his mutton in
the Vatican. Such frivolous reasoning is so unworthy the dignity of
history, that we reject it at once, and confine ourselves to the simple
fact, that the triple crown of Rome was always running in or about
the head of the ambitious churchman.


The time now drew near for Henry to meet Francis I., who,
thinking to flatter Wolsey, requested that the management of the gorgeous
scene might be left entirely to the taste of the Cardinal. Wolsey's
reputation as a getter-up of spectacles was exceedingly well deserved,
for even when at home, he lived in a style of gorgeous magnificence.
Every apartment in his house at Hampton was a set scene of itself,
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 35 -->
with decorations and properties of the most costly character. He
kept eight hundred supernumeraries always about him as servants,
\"of whom nine or ten were noblemen, fifteen knights, and forty
esquires." * Not contented with an ordinary chair, he always sat
with a canopy over his head, and he allowed no one to approach him
except in a kneeling attitude. His dress matched his furniture, for
he wore a crimson satin surtout, with hat and gloves of scarlet, and
even his shoes were silver-gilt—like a pair of electrotyped highlows.
His liveries surpassed even those of the Sheriffs of London; and his
cook positively wore satin or velvet, so that this functionary was
dressed more daintily and delicately than the most recherche of his
own dinners. Wolsey, when he appeared in public, carried an
orange, stuffed with scents, in his hand; for he used to say affectedly
that there was always an exhalation from a vulgar crowd, which
gave him the vapours.


The preparations for the interview between Francis and Elenry
having been intrusted to such a master of all ceremonies as Cardinal
Wolsey, could not fail to be made on a scale of unprecedented
grandeur; and the place where the two monarchs met acquired the
name of the "Field of the Cloth of Gold," from the extreme
gorgeousness of the scene in which they acted. The arrangements
were nearly completed, and Henry had removed to Canterbury, for
the convenience of the journey to France, when Charles of Spain,
being jealous of the anticipated meeting, ran over to the Kentish
coast, to say a few words to the English king before he left for
the Continent.


Charles was received in a most amicable manner, but happening
to see the late Queen Dowager of France, then Duchess of Suffolk,
who might, could, would, or should have been his own wife, he
turned so spoony and sentimental, that he could take no pleasure in
the festivities prepared for him. " No, thank you, none for me! "
was his almost uniform answer to every inquiry whether he would
have a little of this, that, or the other, that was placed before him.
He lost first his spirits, then his appetite, and ultimately his time, for  
  
  
  * Fiddes' " Life of Wolsey," pp. 106, 107.
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 36 -->
he was fit neither for negotiation nor anything else during his stay
in England. Having remained four days, he went home, with a
\"worm in the bud " of his affections, and as he looked at the sea
before him, he was overheard muttering that he should " never get
over it." His courtiers thought he was alluding to the ocean, but he
was in reality soliloquizing on the loss of his heart, which he left
behind him; but happily this is a sort of parcel that can without
much difficulty be recovered. On the day he re-embarked for
Flanders, Henry set sail for France, having only put off his putting off
out of compliment to his illustrious visitor.


A plot of ground between Guisnes and Ardres was fixed upon as
the place of meeting, and a temporary palace—of wood, covered with
sail-cloth—was erected there, for the person and the suite of the
English sovereign. Cunning workmen had painted the sacking at
the top to look like square stones; but it was sacking, nevertheless,
as the inmates found out in rainy weather. The walls glittered with
jewels, like the gingerbread stalls at a fair, and the tables groaned,
or rather, creaked, under massive plate, which proves that the wood
must have been rather green which had been used in making the
furniture. Francis, making up his mind not to be outdone, got an
enormous mast, and throwing an immense rickcloth over the top,
stuck it up umbrella-ways in the part of the field he intended to
occupy. A whirlwind having come on, the old rickcloth got
inflated with the height of its position, and was soon carried away by
the tremendous puffing it experienced. The whole apparatus took,
for a moment, the form of a balloon; and the workmen, seeing it was
all up, ran away just in time to avoid the consequences of a collapse,
which almost instantly happened. Francis was glad to find more
substantial lodgings in an old castle near the town of Ardres, where
Wolsey speedily paid him a morning visit. The Cardinal, who
had only intended to make a short call, remained two days, in
which he arranged an additional treaty with the French king, who
agreed to pay a large sum for the neutrality of England in
continental matters, and " as to Scotland," said Francis, " you and my
mother shall settle that between you ! " " I ? " exclaimed Louisa of
Savoy, with surprise, " I don't know anything about diplomatic
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 37 -->
affairs ! " but the Cardinal flattered the old lady that she did; and,
by blandly remarking " he was positive they should not fall out," he
persuaded her to join him in the arbitration, for he felt pretty sure he
should get the best of the bargain.


Business being concluded, Henry took out of his portmanteau a
new dress of silver damask, ribbed with cloth of gold, and in this
splendid suit of stripes he went forth to meet his brother Francis.
The 7th of June, 1520, and the valley of Andren, were the time and
place of their first coming together, when, according to previous
arrangement, they saluted and embraced on horseback. Had one
waited for the other to dismount and advance, they might have been
standing there to this day, but, by a clever act of equestrianism, they
contrived to go through the form of introduction on the backs of
two highly-trained steeds, to the great admiration of the circle in
the midst of which they exhibited. Francis spoke first, but confined
himself to a commonplace observation on the length of the distance
he had come, and an allusion to the extent of his possessions and
power. Henry replied somewhat cleverly, that " the power and
possessions of Francis were matters quite secondary in importance
to Francis himself, whom he, Henry, had come a long way to see,"
and thus contempt was adroitly blended with compliment. The
royal couple then dismounted, and took a turn arm-in-arm, as if in
friendly conversation, after which they went together into a tent and
partook of a very sumptuous banquet. Spice and wine were served
out in great profusion, in a spirit of liberality equivalent to that
which dispenses " hot elder, with a rusk included, a penny a glass,"
from many modern refectories. There was plenty of a sort of stuff
called " ipocras" given to the people outside; but as we never
tasted any " ipocras," and strongly suspect that it is a decoction from
ipecacuanha, we cannot answer for the quality of the article in which
the people " outside " were allowed to luxuriate.

long feet," as if Hall saw everything double while under the influence
of " ipocras;" but Titian, by toning down the nose, so as to make
its bridge in conformity with the arches of the eyebrows, has turned
out a not unpleasing portrait of the great original.


It had been previously announced that jousts would form part of
the festivities; and accordingly, on the nth of June, these
entertainments began in a very spirited manner. The "braying" of trumpets
made an appropriate introduction to the sports, and the overture
was echoed by braying of a more animated character. Each king
fought five battles every day, and of course came off victoriously in
every one; for the nobles and gentlemen of those times were most
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P60_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 39 -->
complacent in submitting their heads as dummies to aid the
amusements of royalty.


The season of the Field of the Cloth of Gold terminated with a
fancy dress ball, in which Henry made himself very conspicuous by
the character and richness of his disguises. The vastness of his
wardrobe enabled him to astonish every one by the effectiveness
of his " making up," and two or three of his masks were models of
quaint ugliness.


At the end of a fortnight of foolery and feasting, the two
monarchs separated, and the memorable meeting of the Field of the
Cloth of Gold passed from the hands of the costumier, the carpenter,
and the cook, into those of the historian. Its chief result was to
beggar many of the French and English nobles who had taken part
in it, and gone to expense they could not support, to outdo each
other in magnificence. Thus did the Field of the Cloth of Gold
prepare the way for a sort of threadbare seediness, into which many
belonging to both nations were plunged, by their having done up
themselves in an insane attempt to outdo each other.


Our account of the great meeting on the Field of the Cloth of
Gold would not be complete without the following anecdote. Francis
rose very early one morning, and made his way to the quarters of
Henry, who was in bed and fast asleep on the arrival of his
illustrious visitor. The French king shook the English monarch cordially
by the whipcord tassel on the top of his night-cap, when the latter,
springing out of bed, responded to the playful summons. "You
see," said Francis, " I am up with the lark ! " to which Henry added,
\"And I am ready for the bird you have specified." The English king
then expressed himself much obliged for such a mark of attention, and
cast over the neck of Francis " a splendid collar," being, no doubt, the
\"false one " taken off on the night previous. It is believed by some
that Henry, not knowing the object of the intrusion, collared the
intruder at once; but the version of the story which we have already
given appears to be the more probable. Francis, in his turn, clasped
a bracelet on Henry's arm, or rather, according to an ill-natured
reading of the affair, one cuffed the other for the collaring he had
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 40 -->
experienced. Henry rang his bell for his valet, but Francis would
not permit the attendance of any servant, but laid out Henry's clean
things with his own hand, taking in his shaving water, putting out
his highlows to be cleaned, and taking them in again.*  
  
  
  Politeness of Francis to Hen


Henry, on his return from the Field of the Cloth of Gold, took
Gravelines in his way, and gave a look in upon Charles of Castile,
who saw him home as far as Calais. This far-seeing prince saw that
Wolsey had it all his own way with the English king, and the


* The minuteness with which these particulars are detailed, may cause a doubt of
their veracity, but we refer the reader to Mr. Fraser Tytlefs " Life of Henry VIII. • "
in page 123 of which the anecdote we have given is fully recorded.

<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 41 -->
emperor took every possible opportunity of trying to "come over"
the proud prelate. Charles promised his "vote and interest" to
Wolsey, in the event of any vacancy occurring in the papal chair, and
gratified his avarice by making him Bishop of Placentia and Badajos.


Henry, after making a short stayat Calais, returned to Dover,
and reached London without a penny in his pocket, for both he and
his courtiers were completely cleaned out by their recent
extravagance. On the king's arrival, Buckingham got himself into trouble
by his impertinent remarks on the expedition to France, and the
dreadful waste of money that it had occasioned. He particularly
pointed his sarcasms against Wolsey as the originator of all the
expensive fooleries that had been committed, and he took every
opportunity of gainsaying or otherwise insulting the upstart
cardinal. On one occasion, Buckingham had been holding a basin for
Henry to wash his hands, when Wolsey, anxious to have a finger in
everything belonging to the king, plunged his paws into the same
water. The duke, desirous of administering a damper to the
cardinal, spilt a quantity of the liquid over his shoes, when Wolsey
becoming angry, threatened to " set upon his skirts," which meant
in other words, that the cardinal would be down upon him.


There is no doubt that Wolsey took every opportunity of
damaging Buckingham; but the duke himself was obnoxious to the
king, and gave particular offence by hiring a servant who had been
a member of the royal household. Buckingham had been leading
the life of a country gentleman, at what he modestly called his " little
place " in Gloucestershire, when he received an invitation to court;
and, foolishly flattering himself that this little attention was shown to
him on account of his merits, he unsuspectingly obeyed the summons.
When he had proceeded some way on his journey, he found he was
dodged by three disagreeable-looking fellows in block tin, who turned
out to be members of the king's body guard, and who were sure to
be at his heels whenever he looked round over his own shoulder.


Having put up at Windsor for the night, he had no sooner been
shown to his bedroom than he saw the same three fellows loitering
in the yard of the inn he was stopping at. Once or twice, after  
  
  
  VOL. II. c
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 42 -->
retiring to rest, he looked out of his window and fancied he saw one
of the three knights crouching in a corner beneath his lattice, and
he called out to the figure to be off; but the approach of daylight
revealed to him the outline of an innocent water-butt, which he had
during the hours of darkness imperatively desired to quit the

premises. " I know you well," he cried several times to the tub,
\"and you had better go at once; " but his expostulations were of
course disregarded in the quarter to which he was idly addressing
them. Declining to stop at Windsor, he determined to breakfast
the next morning at Egham; but he had no sooner entered the
coffee-room than he was insulted by one Thomas Ward, a creature of
the court, which completely took away the appetite of the duke, of
whom it was cruelly said that he could eat neither egg nor ham
in the hostel at Eg-ham. He then rode on to Westminster, where
he got into his barge and pulled down with the tide as far as
Greenwich, but stopped at Wolsey's house on the way, and sent in
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P64_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 43 -->
his card to the cardinal, who sent out word that he was indisposed,
and declined seeing his visitor. " Umph," said the duke, " I am
sorry to hear that, but I'll step in, and take a glass of wine, if you've
no objection !" After a good deal of whispering among Wolsey's
servants, Buckingham was shown into the cellar, where he took a
draught of wine from the wood; but finding no preparations made
for himj he changed colour—that is to say, he looked rather blue—
and proceeded on his journey. As he continued pulling along the
river, a four-oared, manned by yeomen of the guard, whose captain
acted as coxswain, hailed Buckingham in his barge, which was
instantly boarded by the crew of the cutter.


The duke having been towed ashore, was at once arrested, and
marched in custody down Thames Street, with a mob at his heels, all
the way to the Tower. There were a few cries of " Shame! " and
other demonstrations of disapproval, but the sympathy of the
bystanders having evaporated in a few yells and a mild shower of
cabbage leaves, Buckingham was left in the hands of his captors.
On the 13th of May, 1521, Buckingham was brought to trial on the
charge of tempting Friar Hopkins to make traitorous prophecies.
This Hopkins was an old fortune-telling impostor, who had predicted
all sorts of good luck to poor Buckingham, none of which ever fell to
his lot; so that he had the double mortification of having been
cheated out of his cash, for promises that never came true, and being
punished for them just as much as if they had all been literally
verified. Buckingham defended himself with great courage; and on
being convicted as a traitor, he solemnly declared that he was " never
none:" an indignant mode of exculpation, in which grammar was
sacrificed to emphasis. He died, very courageously, on the 17th of
May, 1521, and the barbarous ceremony of his execution created the
greatest disgust among the populace.


Almost at the very moment that Henry was being guilty of the
enormity we have described, he was putting himself forward as the
champion of Religion. He professed the greatest horror of the errors
and heresies of Luther, whom, in a letter to Louis of Bavaria, he
proposed to burn, books and all, in an early bonfire. Tending that the
great Reformer was not to be thus made light of, Henry turned
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 44 -->
author, and by taking up the pen, he, instead of consigning his
antagonist to the flames, regularly burnt his own fingers. There is
no doubt that the royal scribbler had been thoroughly well crammed
for the task he undertook; and Leo X. having read the book, was
good-natured enough to say, in the language of our old friend the
Evening Paper, that " it ought to be on every gentleman's table."
He published a sort of review of it in a special bull, and made the
remark, that the author might fairly be called " The Defender of the
Faith," a title which was not only adopted by Henry himself, but has
been held, to this very day, by all subsequent English sovereigns.


Francis and Charles, the respective monarchs of France and
Spain, had all this time continued their bickering, and they at length
agreed to ask the arbitration of Henry. He declined interfering
personally, but sent Wolsey in his stead, and the cardinal arrived at
Calais on the 30th of July, 1521, with a magnificent retinue. His
establishment consisted of lords, bishops, doctors, knights, squires,
and gentlemen in crimson-velvet coats, with gold chains round their
necks, which gave to the whole party an aspect of exceeding
flashiness. Wolsey, notwithstanding the number and splendour of
his followers, was at a very trifling expense, for he billeted the whole
party at Bruges upon the unfortunate emperor, or rather upon his
more unfortunate subjects, who were ordered by their sovereign to
find everything that was wanted and put it all down to him in that
doubtful document, the bill, which between a potentate and his
people seldom meets with settlement. Rations of candles, wine, and
sugar,* were served out every evening to the whole of Wolsey's suite,
so that all who wanted it had the ingredients of grog, while the
candles enabled such as were so disposed to make a night of it.


After spending ten days in the enjoyment of every luxury, at the
cost of the contending parties—thus showing that he understood how
to make the very most of his position as an arbitrator—Wolsey
suddenly declared that he saw no chance of Charles and Francis
being reconciled. The wily cardinal having been regularly got
hold of by Charles, drew up a treaty extremely favourable to the

emperor, and even arranged that he should marry Henry's daughter
Mary, though the young lady had been previously betrothed to

This alteration in the domestic arrangements of the parties
concerned was simply declared to be "for the good of Christendom,"*
and Henry agreed to the plan with a nonchalant assurance that he
really thought it the best thing that could be done, for he did not see

"how his said affairs might have been better handled."* Pope
Leo X., who was in league with Wolsey, the Emperor, and Henry,
in their joint arrangements for smashing France, agreed to give the
dispensation for the proposed marriage; but Leo died before the
nuptial treaty had been ratified.


On the death of Leo X. Wolsey lost no time in offering himself
as a candidate for the vacant popedom. Secretary Pace was sent off
at a slapping pace to Rome, to see the members of the conclave, and
solicit their votes and interests for the English cardinal. Pace,
however, seems to have been too slow to be of any use, and Adrian,
Cardinal of Tortosa, who was put up almost in joke, and certainly
to create a diversion against Giulio de Medici, one of the other
candidates, was returned by a large majority. Wolsey's name does
not appear to have been even mentioned on the occasion, and Pace
took no step to further his employer's interests.


Francis having been thoroughly disgusted at the treatment he
had experienced, tried, in the first place to win Henry back to his
cause by entreaties, and next by intimidation, in pursuance of which
he shabbily stopped the pension of the English sovereign. When
two kings fall out, their subjects are usually the sufferers; and
accordingly the English in France, and the French in England,
became the objects of royal spitefulness. Francis stopped all the
British vessels in his ports, and arrested the merchants, while
Henry took his revenge by imprisoning the French ambassador,
and making a wholesale seizure of all property belonging to
Frenchmen. At length the English monarch became so angry, that he
sent a challenge by the Clarencieux Herald offering to fight Francis
in single combat, that each might have the satisfaction of a
gentleman; but whether one refused to go out, or the other drew in, we are
not aware, for we only know that the dispute did not end in a duel.


Doubts have been thrown upon the sincerity of Henry in thus
inviting Francis to a personal encounter, but there is every reason to
believe that, in the words of the Bell's Life of the period, " the
British Pet meant business, though the Gallic Cock, having already  
  
  
  * State Papers.
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 47 -->
won his spurs in other quarters, was not disposed to place them in
jeopardy." Henry, with the customary determination of the English
character, had, no doubt, put himself regularly into training for the
event to come off, and it is not unlikely that he may have frequently
amused himself by a little practice on the effigy of his intended
antagonist. The skill he thus acquired in planting his blows and

putting in the necessary punishment at the proper points, would
have been highly serviceable had he ever been allowed to meet his
man; and it is even said that a bottle of claret was placed in the
middle of the head of the figure, so that Henry might fully realise
the result of his sparring exercise. We know not how far we may
put faith in these ancient records, but we are justified in giving them
to the reader, who will separate, no doubt, the wholesome corn of
fact from the chaff of mere tradition.


In the meantime Charles came over on a visit to his intended
father-in-law, and was introduced to his infant bride, who was a
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P69_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 48 -->
child in arms, at his first interview. Henry and Charles indulged
in a succession of gaieties, for which neither possessed the means,
and Charles even borrowed money of Henry, while the latter made
up the deficiency by running into debt to a frightful extent with
his own people.


The king now began to find that he " must have cash," and he at
once applied to Wolsey to assist him in raising more money. On
these occasions Henry spoke in the most flattering manner to the
cardinal, calling him endearingly his "Linsey Wolsey," in a word,
"his comforter." The prelate readily entered into his master's
views, but candidly pointed out the difficulties of extracting anything
more from the London merchants. They had lately advanced twenty
thousand pounds in a forced loan, and it was determined to vary the
demand upon them, by substituting direct taxation for the empty
form of borrowing. Wolsey ordered the mayor, the aldermen, and
the most substantial citizens of London to attend at his chambers,*
when he announced to them the fact that the sovereign was hard up,
and required pecuniary assistance. "What, again!" cried a voice
which the cardinal pretended not to hear, but proceeded to say that
he should require a return of the amount of their annual monies from
all of them. This proposition was the origin of that income-tax
with which England has since been burdened; and the lovers of
antiquity will feel some consolation in the knowledge that they suffer
under a grievance which is hallowed by its ancient origin. There is
to many a great comfort in being victimised under venerable
institutions, and there are individuals who would rather be plundered in
conformity with what are termed time-honoured principles, than be
fairly dealt with upon any new system.


While, however, we are talking of the simpletons of the present
day, the dupes and victims of the period of Henry VIII. are being
kept waiting in the presence of Wolsey. " Gentlemen," said the
cardinal, "the country is in danger, and the king wants your hearts;"
an announcement which was received with cheers of assent, until it


* Supposed to have been over the gateway of Inner Temple Lane, where Henry
and Wolsey shared the rooms now occupied by their successors, Honey and Skelton
the hair-dressers.
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 49 -->
was followed up by a declaration that he must also try the strength
of their pockets. Murmurs of dissent followed this intimation; but
Wolsey went on boldly to say that the king would only require
onetenth of what they had, and if they could not live on the other
ninetenths, he did not know how they would ever be satisfied. " How
will his Majesty take the contribution r" at length exclaimed one
of the aldermen. " In money, plate, or jewels," cried the cardinal;
\"but at any rate the thing must be done, and therefore go about it." *
A promise was made that the money should be repaid out of the first
subsidy, which would have been a sort of improvement upon the old
practice of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, for it would have been
picking Peter's two pockets at once, and ransacking one under the
pretext of replenishing the other.


Henry certainly had the knack of making his people's money go
a great way, for it went so far when it passed into his hands, that it
never came back again. The enormous sums he had extorted from
the citizens soon melted away in dinner parties, pageants, and other
expenses, so that he was at last, after a lapse of eight years, obliged
to summon a Parliament. It was opened in person by the king, and
the Commons elected Sir Thomas More as their Speaker.


Sir Thomas More presented one of those rare unions of wisdom
and waggery which may occasionally be found, and he was often sent
for to the palace to make jokes for his sovereign. The king would
often take him out on the leads at night, where, after scrambling
through the cock-loft, and getting out upon the tiles, Sir Thomas and
his royal pupil would stand for an hour at a time, conversing on the
subject of astronomy. The dryness of the topic was ever and anon
relieved by the salient wit of More, who had a new joke for every
new star, and appropriate puns for all the planets. He was the
original author of that brilliant but ancient series of pleasantries on
the " milky whey," which have since become so universally popular;
and to him may perhaps be attributed the venerable but not
sufficiently appreciated remark, that the music of the spheres must
proceed from the band of Orion.

The king and Wolsey congratulated each other on having got
Tom More as Speaker, for they thought he would act like one of
themselves, and that he would soon laugh the people out of all the
money they might be required to furnish. Henry and the cardinal
foolishly imagined that the man who sometimes made a joke could
never be serious; but they found out their mistake, for he proved
himself an excellent man of business when occasion required.
Wolsey thought to produce an effect by attending the House in
person, and making a speech on that most unpromising topic the
\"crisis," though it was not such a threadbare subject in those days as
in our own, when a " crisis " may almost be looked for as a quarterly
occurrence. Happily, if we are remarkable for our rapidity in getting
a " crisis " up, we have also a wonderful knack of putting it down
again with equal promptitude.


The speech of Wolsey was listened to without reply; for every
member of the House, considering the cardinal's intrusion a breach
of privilege, remained mute and motionless. Irritated by their
silence, the crafty churchman called up one of the members by name,
and asked him for a speech; but the call might just as well have
been for a song, since the individual indicated did nothing more than
rise up and sit down again. Finding it impossible to get a good word,
or indeed any word at all from the Commons, the cardinal lost his
temper, and declared that, having come from the king, he should
certainly wait for an answer; but Tom More, the Speaker—who, by
the bye, deserved the title, for he was the only one that spoke—began
to show his wit by saying that the fact was, the Commons were too
modest to open their mouths in the presence of so great a personage.
Wolsey withdrew in dudgeon, and after a few days' debate, it was at
length agreed to give the money that had been asked, but to take
five years to pay it in. Though Henry would no doubt have been
perfectly willing to make a sacrifice for ready money, and allow a
considerable discount on a cash transaction, his minister tried to
accelerate the mode of payment without offering any equivalent for a
restriction of the term of credit.


The autumn of the year 1525 was rendered remarkable by the
confusion into which the Londoners were thrown, in consequence of
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 51 -->
the almanack-makers and astronomers having tried to give an
impetus to their trade by throwing into the market a parcel of very
alarming prophecies. It was predicted that the rains would be so
tremendous as to convert the whole wealth of the metropolis into
floating capital, and the merchants, fearing they might not be able
to keep their heads above water, ran in crowds to the suburbs.
Several parted with everything they possessed, and their foolish
conduct in making their arrangements for being swamped, formed a
precedent, no doubt, for a case of recent occurrence, in which an
individual of average income, having been led away by a prophecy
that the world had only two more years to run, invested the whole of
his property in the largest possible annuity he could procure for two
years, being under the firm impression that beyond that time neither
he nor his heirs, executors, or assigns, would have the opportunity of
enjoying a farthing of any surplus. As the world did not keep the
appointment that had been made for it by the calculator of its final
arrangements, he was left without a penny when the time he had
assigned for its duration was up; and thus many had got rid of
everything in 1525, under the expectation that all their sorrows
and possessions would be drowned in the inundation that did—not
happen. During the time the panic prevailed, a few of the
tradesmen and artificers did their best to put it to a profitable account, and
a turner of the time, who was so clever at his business that he could
turn a penny out of anything, constructed several thousand pairs
of stilts, and placing them in his window, labelled " Stilts for the
inundation," he obtained numerous customers.


Wolsey's attention was suddenly called off from matters at home,
by a fresh vacancy in the Popedom, occasioned by the death of
Adrian. The English cardinal immediately despatched a letter to
his royal master, saying how unfit he was for the pontificate; when
Henry, instantly taking the hint, and saying to himself, " Oh! ah !
exactly! I see what Wolsey wants," wrote off strongly to Rome, in
favour of his election. Powerful efforts were made to secure his
return, and push him to the top of the pole; but though he got
several votes, he was completely beaten by Giulio de Medici, who
was elected to the papal chair by a very large majority. Wolsey
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 52 -->
bore his disappointment, to all appearances, exceedingly well; but
the probability is, that he saw the policy of keeping on good terms
with the new pope, who made the cardinal his legate for life, and
granted him a bull empowering him to suppress a number of
monasteries, for the purpose of taking the money they possessed to endow
his own colleges.


Henry and Wolsey declared that the cash should be devoted to
\"putting down " that " Monster Luther," as they sometimes called
him, or that " fellow Luther," as they spoke of him now and then, by
way of change, though his fellow did not exist at the period when
the term was applied to him. Among the many irons that Henry
now had in the fire was an Italian iron, with which he stood a pretty
fair chance of burning his fingers; for he had interfered in the
disputes between Francis I. of France, and the Emperor Charles, who
was at war in Italy. Francis had laid himself down on the
pavement before Pavia, resolved to leave no stone unturned to place a
curb on the foe, and pave his own way to victory. As he lay under
the walls the cream of the Imperial army was poured down upon
him, with a savage violence that causes the blood to curdle at the
bare recital. Thoroughly soured in his hopes, Francis plunged into
the very thick of the Imperial cream, and beating around him with
his sword in all directions, reduced seven men, with his own hand, to
the inanimate condition of whipped syllabubs. His valour availed
him little, for he was removed—to adopt the spelling of the period—
in custardy. He was kept in captivity in Spain, at the strong
fortress of Pizzichitone, from which he wrote home to his
mother—probably for the means of replenishing his sac de nuit—and concluded
his note with the memorable words, " Tout est perdu hors I'honneur;"
which—for the benefit of that portion of the public who may have
learnt their " French without a master," and have, consequently, never
mastered it at all—we translate into "All is lost, excepting honour."


Francis being now completely down, Henry and Wolsey
proposed to Charles that they should combine in making the very most
of the helpless position of their prostrate enemy. Fortunately for the
French king, his two opponents were not only deficient in funds, but
had begun to quarrel; on the old principle, perhaps, that when Poverty

stalks in at the door, Love hops out at the window. The pay of
Charles's forces had fallen fearfully into arrear, and they declared
they would no longer go on fighting upon half-salaries. It was

which Henry had drawn out the scheme, and which was to have put
forward the strength of a double company, comprising a powerful
combination of the English and Imperial troupe—was postponed for
an indefinite period.


Henry, who was ready to sell himself to either party, finding
Charles too poor to purchase him, offered himself without reserve to
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P75_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 54 -->
Francis. Terms were soon arranged, by which Henry was to receive
by instalments two millions of crowns, with a permanent annuity
when the chief sum was paid off; and Wolsey was also handsomely
provided for—at least in the shape of promises. While the
agreement was most solemnly ratified by EYancis himself and the chief of
the French nobility, the Attorney and Solicitor-General of France
privately popped a protest on to the file, in order that the king, who
was particular about his honour, might not have his scruples shocked
should he subsequently feel disposed to break his word and fly off
from his agreement. He found considerable difficulty in effecting his
release without swearing to at least a dozen things he never intended
to perform, and when the document was brought to him, fuli» of
concessions to Charles, he affixed his signature with the indifference of a
man putting his name to a bill, regardless of the amount, which he
does not mean to liquidate. He had no sooner got out of custody,
and found himself comfortably seated before his palace fire, than Sir
Thomas Cheney and Dr. Taylor walked in with a message from
Henry VIII., to congratulate Francis on his delivery. " If you'll
take my advice," said one of the visitors, at the same time handing
his card, with

upon it, to give weight to his words, " you will pay no attention to
the liabilities you have entered into with regard to the Emperor."
\"Indeed, Doctor, I don't mean to trouble myself upon the subject,"
was the king's reply; " and in fact I have kept up a running
accompaniment of private protests to every obligation I have
undertaken." Dr. Taylor explained to him that he was on the safe side,
for the bonds he had given were bad in law, having been executed
while the king was under duress, and therefore not legally responsible.
Thus did the chivalrous Francis, who had written so nobly about
having lost everything except his honour, present an early instance, of
which later times have furnished so many, of the largest talkers being
the smallest doers, or perhaps rather the greatest DOS in the universe.  
  
  
  We have now to relate a curious personal anecdote of Henry VIII.,
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 55 -->
which might have caused a considerable abridgment of his reign,
much in the same way that the want of strength in the bowl in which
the three wise men of Gotha went to sea, put a premature period to
their little history.* Henry, in his early manhood, was one day
running after a hawk, perhaps to put a little salt upon its tail in the
idle hope of catching it. The bird was actively retreating before
its royal pursuer, and had just quitted a hedge by hopping the
twig, when it traversed a ditch on the other side, which Henry
endeavoured to clear by the aid of his leaping-pole. The attempt
somehow failed, and the monarch pitching on to his head in the soft
mud, sunk into it as far as his neck, and became planted with his
legs in "the air for several seconds. Happily a footman named
Edmund Moody—" You all know Tom Moody" though you may
never have heard of Edmund—came up at the instant and pulled the
king up from the ground by the roots—at least by the roots of his
hair—with wondrous promptitude. Had this accident proved fatal,
Henry would have been the first instance of a monarch losing his
crown by being planted instead of supplanted, which had been the
fate of some that had preceded him.


It is now time for us to speak of the commencement of that spirit
of Bluebeardism which ultimately gave the most glaring colouring to
Henry's character. He had always been a little flighty and
indiscriminate in his attentions to the fair sex, but he had hitherto treated
Catherine with respect, until he met with Anne Boleyn, or Bullen,
the daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, who was descended from a
former Lord Mayor of London, but by a series of clever
matchmaking—a talent for which was inherited by Miss Anne—the family
had succeeded in allying itself, by marriage, to some of the proudest
aristocracy in the land.  
  
  
  One of their earliest "dodges" had been to repair the plebeian

word Bullen, by omitting the U and substituting an O, which got it
to Bollen. In the course of time, having been allowed an inch in the
way of license, they took an L, or at least one liquid absorbed
another, and the word now stood Bolen. Subsequently a Y,
without a why or wherefore, was dropped in, and the Bullens, who had
probably acquired their name, originally, from having been
landlords, or perhaps potboys, at the " Bull," had now assumed the
comparatively elegant title of Boleyn, which has since become so famous
in history. Sir Thomas Boleyn, the father of Nancy, had long lived
about the court, and had been employed as a deliverer of messages,
or ticket-porter, for Henry VIII., on some important occasions.
Anne, who was born in the year 1507, had in very early life gone out
to service as maid—of honour—to the king's sister, Mary, who, when
going over to be married to Louis XII., took the girl abroad, where
she picked up a few accomplishments. On Mary's returning home, a
widow, Anne Boleyn found another situation with Claude, the wife
of Francis I., but after remaining in another family or two for a short
time in France, she returned to England, where we find her, in 1527,
engaged as maid of honour to Catherine of Aragon.


Henry having become deeply enamoured of Miss Boleyn, who
had shown a strong determination to stand no nonsense, was
suddenly seized with religious scruples as to his marriage with the
queen; for he found out, seventeen years after the event, that he had
done wrong in allying himself with his brother's widow. The fact
of her being now an oldish lady of forty-three added no doubt
considerably to the pious horror of the king at the step which he had
taken. He accordingly began to think seriously of a divorce; and
when Wolsey was sounded on the subject, the cardinal, for reasons
of his own, yielded a prompt concurrence. He was anxious to pay
off Catherine on account of a quarrel he had had with her nephew the
emperor; and thus, in the words of the poet of Dumbarton Castle,  
  
  
  " He sought to consummate his fiendish part
By breaking a defenceless female's heart."

He was sent as an ambassador to Francis, ostensibly to arrange
about the marriage of Henry's only daughter Mary, but really, as it
is believed, to induce the French king to consent that Wolsey should
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 57 -->
be a sort of acting pope during the investment of the castle of St.
Angelo, where the Spaniards and Germans had made the real
pontiff a prisoner.


Poor Clement bore his ill fortune with patience, though, as long
as the investment of the castle lasted, he used to say it was one of
the most unprofitable investments in which he had ever been
involved, and that nothing but the excessive tightness prevented him
from selling out, for he was quite tired of the security.

We have not yet come to the catalogue of his various female
victims, and we have yet to describe those matrimonial freaks upon
which we would gladly have put a ban by forbidding the banns, had
we lived three centuries in advance of our present existence. We
must, however, speak the truth; and though we might imitate the
author of the play called The Wife of Seven Husbands, who requested
the public to consider that a husband had elapsed between each act,
we will not call upon our readers to imagine that a wife of Henry VIII.
has elapsed between each chapter.


We will now resume our narrative, and in the first place look
after Wolsey, whom we left under orders to proceed to the French
dominions; and as the cardinal must by this time have commenced
the passage across, we will take him at once out of his unpleasant
position, and land him at Boulogne.


Wolsey's reception in France was like that of a royal personage,
and had all the inconveniences of such a compliment; for the firing
of the guns at Boulogne frightened his mule, who had not been
trained to stand fire, and who indulged in a kick-up of the most
extraordinary character. This interview with Francis resulted in
three treaties, which were concluded on the 18th of August, 1527,*
by the first of which it was agreed that the Princess Mary should
marry young EYancis, Duke of Orleans, instead of old Francis, his
father, a point that had hitherto been an open question; the second
treaty concluded a peace, and the third stipulated that nothing done
by the pope during his captivity should take effect, but that as
long as Clement was in durance, which it required all his fortitude
to endure, Wolsey should have the management of ecclesiastical
affairs in England.


The pope himself good-naturedly sent over a bull to confirm the
cardinal in his new powers; and "here certainly," says Lord Herbert,
\"began the taste our king took of governing, in chief, the clergy."
His lordship might have added with truth that Wolsey had performed
the wonderful physical feat of biting off his own nose to 1_e revenged  
  
  
  * Lord Herbert's "Life of Henry VIII.," page 160 of the quarto edition, 1741.
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 59 -->
upon the rest of his face, for it is certain that the taste Henry had
been encouraged to take of power over the church, soon led him to
be discontented with a mere snack, for his appetite grew fearfully by
what it fed upon. Like the modest dropper-in at dinner-time, who
sits down to take " just a mouthful," and is led on to the consumption
of a hearty meal, Henry, who at first simply intended to pick a bit
from the power of the pope, soon became a cormorant of church

influence. Henry's thoughts were seriously occupied with the design
of getting a divorce, and he therefore pretended to be in great alarm
as to the succession to the throne, in consequence of a "public
doubt" as to his marriage being lawful, and the Princess Mary
being legitimate.


There i&feo question that the wish was in this instance father to
the thought, and that so far from Henry's desiring to silence all
discussion on the point, he was the first to encourage the criticism of
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P81_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 60 -->
his wife's and his daughter's position. Notwithstanding his notorious
flirtation with Anne Boleyn—which the forward minx decidedly
encouraged—he pretended to be looking out for an eligible parti in
the event of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon being officially
nullified. He had a picture sent over to him of the Duchess of
Alanson, sister to Francis, and used to pretend that he should
probably set his cap at that lady; but the picture was a mere blind,
or probably in a very short time it experienced a worse fate than
that of a blind, by being turned into a fire-board or consigned to a
lumber-room.


The love-making of Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn was a
mixture of mawkishness, childishness, hypocrisy, and scholastic pedantry,
tinctured with an affectation of religion that was not the least
disgusting feature of this disgraceful courtship. Henry used to write
love-letters full of extracts from Thomas Aquinas, complaints of
head-ache, reference to pious books, and sickly sentimentalism about
\"mine own sweet heart; " while the good-for-nothing Nancy B.
would reply by sending him pretty little toys and pretty little words
of encouragement. She had made good use of her time in Wolsey's
absence, for when the cardinal came back, the king, in answer to his
own question, "Guess who's the gal of my art?" which his friend
gave up, enthusiastically responded, Anne Boleyn.


The already corpulent monarch was stupidly and spoonily
lovesick about this " artful puss," as Catherine (might have) called her,
and he used to leave scraps of paper about the palace, scribbled over
with charades, conundrums, and anagrams, to the object of his
admiration.* Wolsey was a good deal annoyed by this avowal, but
finding his opposition would do no good, he changed his tack, and
fell in with the sovereign's fancy. Henry ordered him to consult Sir
Thomas More, who not at all liking the job, referred him politely to
St. Jerome and St. Augustine, saying, it was more in their way than

Chap. IV.]

his own, and he felt any interference on his part would be irregular
and unprofessional. Wolsey next tried the bishops, who shook their
heads, and said, " You had better ask the pope," to whom the king
at last determined upon a reference.


The pope, whom we left locked up in the castle of St. Angelo, had
been obliged to "come out of that" for want of provisions, and had
escaped in the disguise of a gardener, in which a shovel hat may have
been of some use to him. He played his cards so well as the one of
spades, that with the assistance of one or two true hearts, who turned
out trumps, he reached in safety the town of Orvieto, where he
expected reinforcement from a French army. Long before the
promised aid arrived, he received a card inscribed " Dr. Knight," and
he had scarcely time to say, " Doctor Knight, who is Doctor
Knight? I don't know any Doctor Knight," when the King of
England's secretary, who bore that name, rushed into the presence
of the pontiff.


The doctor having briefly explained his object in coming, which was
to get the pope's consent to Henry's divorce, succeeded in extracting
the requisite authority from his holiness, who was very unwilling, but
he could not keep back his bull without finding himself on the horns
of a worse dilemma. He at all events wished the matter to be kept
secret for a short time; but a friend of Wolsey stepped forward to
stipulate that an Italian cardinal should be sent to England with Dr.
Knight, to prove that the document he took with him was genuine.
Poor Clement, being afraid to refuse compliance, pointed to
half-adozen cardinals standing in one corner, and hurriedly observed,
\"There, there, Dr. Knight, take any one of those, for the whole six
are quite at your service." In conformity with this permission,
Cardinal Campeggio was selected to visit England, and he carried
with him in his pocket a decree, rendering final any judgment that
he and Wolsey might agree upon.


On the arrival of Campeggio a public entry into London was
proposed; but he excused himself on the score of gout, which had laid
him by the heels, or rather seized him by the great toe, and
prevented him from coming into the metropolis on the footing that he
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 62 -->
might have desired. After spending a few days with his leg in a
sling, he was introduced to the king, whom he greatly irritated by
advising that the business of the divorce should not be proceeded
with. Henry began declaring that he had been deceived, and that
the pope was an old humbug, which caused the gouty leg of the
legate to tremble in its shoe; and, taking the bull from his pocket,
he showed that the pontiff meant business, and had given full
authority for transacting it.


Henry's desire for a divorce got soon rumoured about the city,
and caused so much dissatisfaction that he called a meeting of the
judges, lord mayor, common council, and others, at which it was
announced that his majesty would attend to give explanations, and
enter into a justification of his conduct.


He made an elaborate speech of the most artful and hypocritical
kind, in which he asserted that his religious scruples alone made him
agitate the question of a divorce, and that if his marriage was valid,
nothing would give him greater pleasure than to finish his life in the
society of the old lady, who had been for many years the partner
of his existence. It is notorious that he had made up his mind to
desert Catherine for Anne Boleyn; and his speech is therefore a
disgusting specimen of low cunning, rendered doubly odious by the
religious cant with which it was accompanied.


The unhappy queen, when visited by Wolsey and Campeggio,
exclaimed at once, "I know what you have come about." She said
she thought it hard to have her marriage doubted after nearly twenty
years; and spoke pathetically of those early days when she was in
the habit of going out a-Maying with her royal husband. " Ah,
madam !" replied Wolsey, " if we could have May all the year
round, it would be pleasant enough; but the spring of the year, as
well as the spring-time of existence, is not perpetual."


Catherine acknowledged she was not so young as she had
been, and the English cardinal ventured to hint, that, even in
those Maying days, she had the advantage of Henry,—at least, if
there can be any advantage to a lady who is her husband's senior.
Finding pathos of no use, she proceeded to argument, and
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 63 -->
endeavoured to show that Henry had almost lost his claim to a divorce
by mere laches, in having so long neglected to apply for one.
The two cardinals only shook their heads, as if they would say,
\"I can't see much in that; " and she then ventured to take
another ground for opposing her husband's project. She
complained that her father had paid for the licence and dispensation
from the pope, but that the dispensations might be dispensed with

as valueless, if one could supersede another at the instigation
of the great and powerful against the comparatively friendless
and impotent.


At length, losing all temper and patience, she turned to Wolsey,
taxing him with having " done it all; " when the wily cardinal did
nothing but bow and smile in general terms, placing his hand upon
his heart, muttering out, "'Pon honour! " "Nothing of the sort!"
and giving other similar assurances that he had in no way
instigated the conduct pursued by Henry.


The preliminary meeting to which we have referred was held in
the Hall of the Black Friars, on the 31st of May, 1529; and an
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P87_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 64 -->
adjournment till the 21st of June having taken place, Wolsey and
Campeggio were at their posts at the appointed hour. Henry and
Catherine were both in attendance; and the former, when his name
was called, gave a terrific shout of " Here!" which had a startling
effect upon the whole assembly. Catherine, though she might be
considered upon her trial, was accommodated with a seat on the
left of the bench, and was attended by four friendly bishops, who
had come in the amiable capacity of moral bottle-holders to this
injured woman.


When her name was called she refused to answer, or to say
a word; but the dignity of the queen soon gave way to the
volubility of the woman, and her tongue started off into a gallop of
the most touching eloquence. She commenced in the old style of
appeal, by throwing herself at the king's feet, presuming perhaps
that if he had a tender point it might be upon his toes, and she
should thus make sure of touching it. She then implored his
compassion, as a woman and a stranger, concluding with a happy
alliterative effect by declaring herself " a friendless female foreigner."


At the conclusion of a very powerful speech she rose slowly, and
when it was expected she would return to her seat, she marched
deliberately out of the hall, to the great amazement of the friendly
quartette of bishops by whom she had been accompanied.


Henry was a little staggered by what had occurred; but he
nevertheless made a reply, which was partly inaudible from the flurry of the
king himself, and the consternation into which the court had been
thrown by the queen's very telling speech, and highly dramatic exit.
He was understood to say, that he had a very high respect for the
distinguished lady who had just addressed them; that she was a very
good wife; that he had in fact no fault to find; but that really his
scruples as to the lawfulness of his marriage had made him very
uncomfortable. He remarked that his conscience was so exceedingly
delicate that it could not bear the slightest shock; and here indeed
he seems to have spoken the truth, for his conscience appears to
have died altogether within a very short time of the occurrence
we have mentioned.
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 65 -->

Catherine's departure from the court turned out to be final, for
nothing could induce her to enter it again; and, being pronounced
contumacious, the proceedings were carried on in her absence. The
two cardinals, out of regard to her majesty's interests, requested Dr.
Taylor—an aged junior in the back rows—to hold a brief for the
defendant, and examine the witnesses: a proposition at which the
learned gentleman jumped, for he had previously been occupying his
own mind and the official ink in sketching the scene before him on
the desk, or handing down his name to posterity by cutting it out on
the bench with a pocket penknife.


Dr. Taylor, if he had practised little before, had quite enough
to do on the occasion that brought him into notice, for Lord
Herbert, in his " Life and Reign of Henry VIII.," gives a list of
thirty-seven witnesses for the plaintiff, all of whom our venerable
junior had the task of cross-examining. Some idea may be
formed of the magnitude of this achievement, when it is stated
that several of the witnesses were ladies, and that the evidence of
the first of them—namely, Mary, Countess of Essex—is summed
up in the report as having amounted to "little," though conveyed
in " general terms."


There is something truly overwhelming in the idea which this
slight summary conveys; for it is impossible that the imagination
can set any limits to the " little " a lady can contrive to say when
she avails herself of " general terms " to give it utterance. Cardinal
Campeggio evinced a decided reluctance to bring the matter to a
decision, though Henry's case was undoubtedly well supported by
evidence; and old Taylor being, professionally speaking, a young
hand, was able to do little for his absent client. The king at length
grew angry at Campeggio's delay, and instructed counsel to move
for judgment, which was accordingly done on the 23rd of July in a
somewhat peremptory manner. The Italian cardinal refused the
motion, and intimated that he would not be bullied by any man, "be
he king or any other potentate." He then went on to say, that " he
was an old man, sick, decayed, and daily looking for death: " which
certainly gave no reason for delay; and a whisper to that effect went
no doubt round the bar, and was caught up by Henry's counsel, who  
  
  
  VOL. II. K
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 66 -->
"humbly submitted" that "if the court expected to be soon
defunct, there must be the stronger reason for fixing an early day
for its decision."


Cardinal Campeggio got up somewhat angrily, and intimated
that the cause must be made a "remanel; " that in fact it must stand
over until next term, as he was not disposed to continue his sittings.
"Is your lordship aware," asked Sampson,* K.C., "that you will
throw us over the long vacation; for we are now only in July, and
the next term begins in October." The cardinal, who was half-way
towards the robing-room, turned sharply round to observe that " the
court was virtually up," and that " he really wished gentlemen of the
bar would observe more regularity in their proceedings." Sampson,
{empty}K.C., had nevertheless got as far as " Will your lordship allow
us," in another attempt to be heard, when Campeggio, growling out
furiously, " I can hear nothing now, Mr. Sampson," retired angrily
to his private apartment. The court never met again, and Campeggio
left England a few days afterwards, having first taken leave of the
king, who kept his temper, and behaved very decently. He even
gave a few presents to the refractory cardinal; but as the latter lay
at Dover, previous to embarkation, his bed-room door was burst
open, his trunks were rummaged, and probably all his presents were
taken away again.


Wolsey, who had been associated in the hearing of the great
cause, Henry versus Catherine, or the Queen at the suit of the King,
fell into instant disgrace for the part he had taken, or rather for the
part he had omitted to take, upon this momentous occasion. Miss
Anne Boleyn, who had calculated on his keeping Campeggio up
to the mark in pronouncing for the divorce, was especially angry
with Wolsey for his apathy. Even the courtiers got up a joke
upon the supineness of the English cardinal by calling him the
supine m{h)um, while Campeggio was compared to the gerund in
do, by reason of his active duplicity, through which he was declared
to have regularly done the English sovereign. Many of the nobility


* The King's leading counsel was Richard Sampson, with whom was John Bell.—
Lord Herbert's "Life of Henry VHIf page 205.
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 67 -->
attempted to excite the avarice of Henry by hinting* to him that
Wolsey's overthrow would be a good speculation, if only for the
sake of obtaining the wealth he had managed to accumulate; and
from this moment the cardinal stood in the precarious position
of a turkey that is only crammed to await the favourable
opportunity for sacrifice.  
  
  
  
Cardinal Campegglo and Mr. Sampson.
"I can hear nothing now, Mr. Sampson."


Soon after the trial of his cause, in which he thought proper to
assume that he was entitled to a verdict, Henry set off on a tour,
accompanied by Miss Anne Boleyn, who, in spite of Hume's panegyric on
her "virtue and modesty," appears to have been what is commonly
called a very pretty character. Wolsey was not invited to be of the
party, but he rode after the court, for he was one of those hangers-on
that are not to be shaken off very easily. He came up with the king
at Grafton, in Northamptonshire, and was very kindly received, but
the next morning he was told distinctly that he was not wanted in
the royal suite, and that he might go back to London; after which he
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P91_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 68 -->
never saw his master's face again.* Henry being anxious to ruin
his late favourite selon les regies, took the very decisive method of
going to law with him.


Two bills were filed against the cardinal in the King's Bench;
but Wolsey, nevertheless, proceeded to the Court of Chancery
to take his seat, just as if nothing had happened. None of the
servants of the court paid him any respect; and it is probable that
even the mace-bearer, the ushers, and other officers omitted the
customary ceremonies of preceding him with the mace, and crying
out, "Pray silence!" upon his entrance. On his expressing his
readiness to take motions, he was responded to by one general
motion towards the door, in which the whole bar joined. Being thus
left quite alone, he amused himself by giving judgment in some old
suit, which had lasted so long that the parties were all dead, and he
consoled himself by saying that this accounted for the fact of nobody
appearing on either side.


The king, hearing of the cardinal's proceedings, gave orders that
he should be forbidden the court altogether, and when he went to
take his seat as usual, he found the doors closed against him. When
he got home to York Place, where he resided, he was told that two
gentlemen were waiting to see him, and on going upstairs, the
Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk requested to have a few words with
him. They told him that the king intended to come and live at
York Place, so that Wolsey must " turn out," to which he made no
objection; but when they insolently and tauntingly demanded the
Great Seal, he declared he would not trust it in their possession
without a written authority. " How do I know what you are going
to do with it r" cried the cardinal, holding it firmly in his grasp,
and returning it to the seal-skin case in which he was in the habit
of keeping it.


The two dukes having exhausted their vocabulary of abuse,
retired for that day, but came back the next morning with an
order, signed by the king, for the delivery of the Great Seal, which
Wolsey gave up to them, together with an inventory of the furniture  
  
  
  * Cavendish.
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 69 -->
and fixtures of the magnificent abode he was about to vacate in
favour of his sovereign. The catalogue exhibited a long list of
luxurious appointments, and, commencing with " a splendid set of
curtains of cloth of gold,"* went on with—a ditto—a ditto—and a
ditto, down to the end of the three first pages. The neatness and
variety of his table-covers cannot be conceived, and his magnificent

side-board of gold and silver plate was in those days unparalleled.
He had got also a thousand pieces of fine Holland; but as the chief
use of Holland is, we believe, to make blinds, we must regard his
purchase of this material in so large a quantity as one of those blind
bargains which are sometimes the result of excessive opulence.
Having made over all those articles to the king, Wolsey left his
sumptuous palace, and jumping into a barge, desired the bargemen
to drop him down with the tide towards Putney. The river was  
  
  
  * Herbert's " Life of Henry VIII.," and Hume's " History of England."
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P93_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 70 -->
crowded with boats to see him shove off, and he was assailed with
the most savage yells from the populace. As the bargeman gave
Wolsey his hand and pulled him on board, the'poor cardinal
stumbled over a block of Wall's End, when an inhuman shout of
"That's right, haul him over the coals," arose from one unfeeling
brute, and was echoed by countless multitudes.


On reaching Putney, Wolsey gave the word to " pull her in
shore," when he disembarked, with his fool and one or two others
who had agreed to share his exile. They had not gone very far
when they heard a cry of " Ho! ho! hilly hilly ho ! " and looking
back, they perceived Sir John Norris coming full pelt after them.
The cardinal was mounted on a mule—hired probably at Putney, or
picked off the common—and though he endeavoured to put the
animal along by giving her first her own head, and then the head of
a thick stick, the rise of a hill brought Wolsey to a dead stand-still.
Here he was easily overtaken by Sir John Norris, who came, as it
turned out, with a present of a ring from the king's own finger, and
a " comfortable message."


The abject cardinal went into the most humiliating ecstasies,
and actually grovelled in the very mud, to show his humble sense
of the kindness and condescension of his sovereign. Thinking that
Sir John Norris possibly expected something for his trouble in
bringing the grateful tidings, Wolsey shook his head mournfully,
saying, "I have nothing left except the clothes on my back—but
here, take this"—and he tore from his neck an old piece of
jewellery. "As for my sovereign," he cried, "I have nothing
worthy of his acceptance;" when suddenly his eyes lighted upon
his faithful fool, who had been such a thorough fool as to follow
a fallen master. "Ha!" exclaimed Wolsey, "I will send to his
majesty my jester, who is worth a thousand pounds to anybody who
has never heard his jokes before; but as I am familiar with the
entire collection, I have no further use for him."


The faithful fool was exceedingly reluctant to go, and it took six
stout yeomen * to drag him away—a fact which, as he was full of wit,  
  
  
  * Lord Herbert, 293.
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 71 -->
proves the humour of the period to have been dreadfully ponderous.
Some of the jests of our own time are heavy enough, but we doubt
whether it would require half-a-dozen porters to carry a professed
wag of the present day—including the burden of his entire
stock-intrade—into the presence of royalty. It is not impossible that the
obstinate resistance of the fool to a transfer from the service of a
disgraced subject to that of a powerful king, may have been intended as
a sample of his style of joking; but we can only say that if this was
a specimen of his wit, the value set upon him by his old master was
rather exorbitant.


Wolsey now lodged at Esher, where his spirits soon fell—if we
may be allowed an engineering phrase—to a very dumpy level.
Continual sighing had fearfully reduced his size, and he fretted so
much that a sort of fret-work of tears seemed to be always hanging
to his eye-lashes. His face became wrinkled and pale, as if constant
crying had not only intersected his countenance with little channels,
but had likewise washed out all its colour. It is not unlikely that he
sometimes regretted having parted with his fool, whose dry humour
might have mitigated the moisture or subdued the soaking which
naturally resulted from the emptying of so many cups of sorrow
over the dismal drooping and dripping cardinal. Nothing seemed
to rouse him from his despondency, and the people about him could
never succeed in stirring him up to a fit of even temporary gaiety.
After dinner they would sometimes ask him to partake of a bowl of
sack; but at the mere mention of the word sack he would burst into
tears, and sob out that the sack he had already received had been
the cause of all his wretchedness. Upon this he would leave the
dinner-table, and wander forth to enjoy his solitary whine in the
wood, among the thickly planted solitudes in the neighbourhood
of Esher. Sometimes he would sit pining for hours under a
favourite pine, or would go and indulge in a weeping match with
one of the most lachrymose he could find of weeping willows. All
this crying brought on a crisis at last, and Wolsey had so damped
all his vital energies by the incessant showers of tears he let fall,
that he fell into a slow fever.  
  
  
  The king now seemed to take some compassion upon his former
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 72 -->
friend, and sent down a medical man to see the prostrate cardinal;
though we are inclined to attribute this anxiety for his health to a
desire to keep him alive until the process was complete for depriving
him of all his property. At all events a Parliament was suddenly
summoned, and a bill of impeachment promptly prepared against
the fallen and feeble Wolsey.


There were no less than four-and-forty articles in this document,
which contained, among a variety of other ridiculous accusations, a
charge of having, when ill with a fever, " come whispering daily in
the king's ear, and blowing upon his most noble grace with breath
infective and perilous." This would, indeed, have been convicting
him out of his own mouth; but though the Lords passed the bill, it
was thrown out in the Commons, through a speech of Thomas
Cromwell, who had been secretary to the unfortunate cardinal.


Wolsey had always felt that when he did fall, he should fall not
only as Shakespeare said, " like Lucifer," but like an entire box of
lucifers, " never to rise again." Directly the cardinal learned that
the bill had been defeated, his appetite returned, his cheeks resumed
their colour, the furrows began to fill out, for grief had been at sad
work with its plough all over his countenance. He had still a good
deal of property left, but the king began tearing it away by handfuls
at a time, until Wolsey had nothing left but the bishoprics of York
and Winchester. Even these were a good deal impoverished by
Henry, who made a series of snatches at the revenues, and divided
the amount among Viscount Rochford, the father of Anne Boleyn—
who used to say, " I am sure papa would like that," whenever there
was a good thing to be had—the Duke of Norfolk, and a few other
lay cormorants. Wolsey was at length completely beggared, by
treatment that was of such an impoverishing nature as really to
beggar description. He had nothing left him, but a free pardon, a
little plate—including two table-spoons, which his enemies said were
more than his desert,—a small van of furniture, comprising, among
other articles, an arm-chair, in which he was tauntingly told he
might set himself down comfortably for life, and a little cash for
current expenses. He was allowed also to move nearer town,
and giving up his lodgings at Esher he took an apartment at
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 73 -->
Richmond, where he was not permitted to remain very long,
for Anne and her party—including several knights of the Star
and Garter—persuaded Henry to order the cardinal off to his own
archbishopric.


The fallen prelate thought this forced journey so very hard that
he tried to soften it by easy stages, and he travelled at the slowest
possible pace, in the hope of being sent for back again. At every
inn he entered for refreshment on the road he always left a request
in the bar, that if any one should -ask for a gentleman of the
name of Wolsey, the inquirer should be shown straight up, without
the delay of an instant. Not a knock came to the door of his
bedroom but he expected it was a messenger from the king; and when
he found, in many cases, it was " only the boots," his
disappointment would vent itself in terms of great bitterness. Adopting the
customary mode of showing grief in those superstitious days, he
took to wearing shirts made of horse-hair next his skin, but
donkey's-hair would certainly have been more appropriate. He had
however, become so accustomed to hard rubs, that a little extra
scarification was scarcely perceptible. On his arrival at York, he
endeavoured to make himself neighbourly with the people about
him, and became a sort of gentleman farmer, expressing the utmost
interest in rural affairs. He made himself an universal favourite,
and was the lion of every evening party within twelve miles of
his residence. He was, however, scarcely a figure for these
reunions, in his horse-hair shirt; but he probably concealed the
penitential part of his costume by wearing a camel's-hair waistcoat
immediately over it.


The clergy were always getting up little fetes, of which he was
the hero: and he was invited to the ceremony of installation in his
cathedral, which he promised to go through, on condition of the
thing being done as quietly as possible. It was understood that
there should be " no fuss," but several of the nobility and gentry
sent contributions of cold meat and wine, forming themselves in fact
into a provisional committee, so that the affair partook rather of the
character of a pic-nic than of a pageant. Three days before it was
to take place Wolsey was sitting at dinner when there came a knock  
  
  
  VOL. II. L
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 74 -->
  
  at the door, and it was announced that the Earl of Northumberland

—his friend and pupil—was waiting in the court-yard. " Let him
come up and do as we are doing," exclaimed the cardinal. "Dear
me, I wish he had been a little earlier; but he is just in
puddingtime, at any rate."


As Northumberland entered the room Wolsey seized him by
the hand, entreating him to sit down and enjoy a social snack
—or, in other words, go snacks in the humble dinner.
Northumberland seemed much affected, when Wolsey, continuing his
meal, observed, " Well, you will not make yourself at home, and
I can't make you out, so I may as well finish my dinner." At length
Northumberland, with a tottering foot, a trembling hand, a quivering
lip, a faltering tongue, and a tearful eye, approached his friend
Wolsey, and threw himself with a heavy heart—adding at least a pound
to his weight—upon the old man's bosom. Wolsey had scarcely
time to exclaim, " Hold up ! " when the Earl, mournfully tapping the
cardinal on the shoulder, murmured, in a voice completely
macadamised with sobs, " My lord—(oh, oh, oh !)—I arrest you—(here
his voice became guttural from a perfect gutter of tears)—for high
treason." Poor Wolsey remained rooted to the spot, but it was soon
necessary to transplant him, and he was speedily removed in custody.
His old weakness again came over him, for he began to leak again
at both eyes, as if he carried the veritable New River Head under
the hat of a cardinal. He of course made himself ill, and indeed he
was frequently warned that if he continued much longer in this
liquid state, he would liquidate the debt of nature altogether. The
warning was verified very speedily, for on reaching Leicester Abbey,
when the monks came to the door with a candle to light him to bed,
he observed to the abbot, "Father, I am come to lay my bones
among you." He died on the 29th of November, 1530, in the sixtieth
year of his age, and was buried in Leicester Abbey.


News of his death was at once despatched to Henry, who was
having a little archery practice at Hampton Court on the arrival of
the messenger. The king continued his sport for some time, until
the straw man, upon whom he was trying his skill, had become
thoroughly trussed with arrows, when his majesty turned round with
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 75 -->
an abrupt " Now then, what is it?" to the bearer of the sad
intelligence. At the tale of Wolsey's death Henry pretended to be much
affected, but he soon recovered his spirits sufficiently to inquire
whether a sum of £1500 had not been left by the cardinal. The
king expressed a desire to administer to his lamented friend's effects,
but when the discovery was made, that instead of having to
leave, Wolsey had just borrowed and spent that amount, his royal
master thought it as well to have nothing to do with the business.
Poor Wolsey had been the unfortunate goose who might have
continued laying golden eggs for a considerable time had not Henry
cut him prematurely up for the sake of immediate profit.


We cannot part with Wolsey until we have dropped a few inky
tears to his memory. We have already seen that his talents were
considerable, but according to one of his biographers* he had a
most elastic mind, or in other words he could " pull out" amazingly
when occasion required.


Some time before Wolsey's death a new ministry had been
appointed, in which the family and friends of Anne Boleyn got very
snug berths; but though in those days " any fool " could have a
seat in the cabinet, it was necessary to have a chancellor of good
abilities. The woolsack was literally in the market for a few days,
until Henry thrust it on to the shoulders of Sir Thomas More, who
would have declined the profitable burden, and who was somewhat
averse to the sack of wool, because he felt that much of the material
was obtained by fleecing the suitors. He, however, was persuaded
to accept the dignity, or rather to undertake the burden, and he was
even heard to say—by a gentleman who wishes to remain incog.—
that he wished there were porters' knots for moral responsibilities
as well as for actual weights, since it was exceedingly difficult to
preserve one's uprightness beneath a load of dignity.


Among the persons recently introduced to court was Thomas
Cranmer, who happened to have met Dr. Gardiner, the king's
secretary, and Dr. Fox, at a private dinner table. As the party sat over
their wine, the divorce of Henry was brought upon the tapis, and  
  
  
  * Gait, page 199, Bogue's European Library.
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 76 -->
Cranmer made the sagacious observation, that the proper way would
be to have it looked into. Gardiner and Fox exchanged glances, as
much as to say " Shrewd fellow that; " and they both agreed that
he was a wonderful man for his age—which it will be remembered
was the sixteenth century. They endeavoured to bring him out, and
upon a free circulation of the bottle, Cranmer gave it as his opinion
that there was " only one course to pursue," that " the thing lay in a
nutshell," that " it was as clear as A, B, C; " a series of sentiments
which, though more knowing than conclusive, made a deep
impression on Fox and Gardiner. "There's a great deal in that
fellow," said Fox after Cranmer had gone home, and indeed there
was a good deal in him no doubt, for scarcely anything had been
got out of him.


The two doctors hastened to the king to inform him of the
enormous catch they had got in Cranmer, whose winks, innuendos,
and occasional ejaculations of " I see it all; " " Plain as a
pikestaff," &c, &c, had made such a deep impression upon the two
doctors. Henry was as much taken with their description of
Cranmer as they had been with the original, and the king exclaimed in
a perfect rhapsody, " That man has got the right sow by the ear; " *
an expression which we are sufficiently pig-headed not to appreciate.
It was arranged that Cranmer should be asked to dine at the palace;
and after a good deal of desultory conversation, in which " Exactly,"
\"I see it," " No question about it," were Cranmer's running fire of
ad captandum remarks, Henry got so puzzled that he requested the
gentleman to put his opinions in writing at his earliest convenience.


The individual who had thus received instructions to act as
pamphleteer in ordinary to the king, was sprung from an ancient
family in Nottinghamshire, but he was destined for higher things
than dragging out the thread of his existence in Notts, as we shall
soon see when we proceed to unravel his history. His early
education had been somewhat neglected, for his father was a sportsman,
who took more delight in going out to shoot than in teaching the
young idea how to follow his example. Young Cranmer's master  
  
  
  * Todd's " Life of Cranmer," Tytler's " Life of Henry the Eighth," &c, __c.
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 77 -->
was a severe priest, who ruled his pupils with a rod of iron, and
thrashed them with a rod of a different material. He snapped many
a whip over the young whipper-snappers, as he was in the habit of
calling his youthful charges, who, at all events, became hardened by
the salutary treatment they experienced.


Cranmer applied himself with diligence to his studies, and in turn
took pupils of his own at Cambridge, where he happened to meet
one day at dinner with Fox and Gardiner, who, as we have already
seen, introduced him to the sovereign. The pamphleteer elect to
Henry VIII. was lodged in the house of the Earl of Wiltshire, the
father of Anne Boleyn, who used to lock the author up in a garret,
with a pen and ink and something to drink, upon which he received
instructions to " fire away " in support of the views of his master.
Cranmer soon rattled off a treatise in which he smashed the pope,
demolished every objection to Henry's divorce, and proved to the
satisfaction of the king that he could do as he liked as to contracting
a second marriage. " Would you say as much to the pope
himself?" asked Henry of his literary man. "Ay, that I would, as
soon as look at him," was the reply; upon which Cranmer was
taken at his word, and sent off to Rome with old Boleyn, now the
Earl of Wiltshire.


As they entered the papal presence, Clement held out his
toe to receive the usual homage, but the old earl positively declined
to perform the humiliating ceremony, and after the pontiff had stood
upon one leg for a considerable time, he found that he and his visitor
must meet upon an equal footing. Cranmer, though not allowed a
public disputation with the pope, took every opportunity of
earwigging the people about him, and got many of them to admit that
the king's marriage was illegal, though they would not acknowledge
that his holiness had no power to give it validity. Though Cranmer's
pamphlet had proved everything, it had done nothing, and Henry
beginning to speak of his exertions as " all talk," another tool was
required to carry out the royal project. This tool came originally
from a blacksmith's shop in Putney, in the shape of one Thomas
Cromwell, of whom it has since been said that he was a sharp file,
who would cut right through a difficulty, while Cranmer was active
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 78 -->
enough in hammering away at a point, but his hitting the right nail
upon the head was generally very dubious.


The father of Cromwell did smiths' work in general, but nothing
at all in particular, for he had amassed a decent fortune. His son
was sent as a clerk to a factory at Antwerp, where he kept the
books; but he soon abandoned accounts in the hope of cutting a
figure. He entered the army, and was present when Rome was
made a bed of ruins, by getting a complete sacking. He next entered
the counting-house of a merchant of Venice, who dealt in Venetian
blinds and Venetian carpeting, but young Cromwell soon threw up the
one and indignantly laid down the other. On arriving in London, he
commenced the study of the law, and took chambers in Inner Temple
Lane, which was, even at that early period, the grand mart of legal
ability. Wolsey, who had lodgings over the gate hard by,* was in
the habit of meeting Cromwell, who eventually became what is
professionally termed " the devil " of that ingenious advocate.


On the fall of his senior, Cromwell contrived to keep just far
enough off to prevent himself from being crushed by the weight of
the unfortunate cardinal, and offering his services to the king, was
immediately retained in the great cause of Henry VIII. versus
Catherine of Aragon, ex parse Anne Boleyn. By the advice of Cromwell
the authority of the pope was set at defiance, and in 1532 a
law was passed prohibiting the payment to him of first-fruits;
\"which do not mean," says Strype, " the earliest gooseberries, to
enable his holiness to play at gooseberry fool, but the first profits
of a benefice."


Henry at last determined to cut the gordian knot, by forming
another tie, and in January, 1533, he solved the question of the
divorce by marrying Anne Boleyn. The ceremony was performed
in a garret at Whitehall, in the presence of Norris and Heneage,
who were a couple of grooms, and of Mrs. Savage, the train-bearer
of the bride, whose wedding came off much in the style of those

first brief, and other curious relics.
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 79 -->
clandestine affairs, in which the clerk gives the lady away, and the
old pew-opener acts in the capacity of bridesmaid. Cranmer, who
had lately arrived in town for the season, found a vacancy in the see
of Canterbury, which he consented to fill up, without scrupling to
take the usual oaths to the pope, though openly avowing himself a
Protestant. Clement himself not only ratified the election of the
man he knew was committing perjury, but even consented to make
a reduction in the fees that were usual on similar occasions.


Thus did these two precious humbugs humbug each other and
their contemporaries; but the historian will not allow them any
longer to humbug posterity. Cranmer swore obedience against his
conscience, and intending to break his oath, but intent on obtaining
the dignity which he could purchase by perjury, and Clement took a
reduced fee, on the principle of half a loaf being better than no
bread, from a man who, on the slightest opposition being offered to
him, might have snapped his fingers at the papal chair as he did in
his heart—if one can snap one's fingers in one's heart—at the papal
authority. Thus did the great champions of Protestantism on one
side, and Catholicism on the other, agree in a disgraceful
arrangement, by which one sold his sacred authority for a pecuniary bribe,
and the other bartered his conscience for a temporary dignity.


It has been said by Cranmer's apologists, that he took his false
oaths with a mental reservation; but if this excuse were allowed to
prevail, the conscience would possess a salve as efficacious as that of
the quack which was warranted to cure every disease from apoplexy
to chilblains, and prevent the necessity of patients with delicate
lungs from exporting.themselves abroad to avoid the danger of being
left for home consumption.


The contemplation of so much hypocrisy, in such high quarters,
having put us so thoroughly out of patience that we are unable
to proceed, we break off here with the remark, that tergiversation
and treachery have ever been common among even the highest
in rank, and so we fear they will continue to be until—ha! ha!—
THE END OF THE CHAPTER.

  Henry the Eighth (concluded)  
  
  
  HOUGH Henry VIII. had
already married Anne Boleyn,
the little affair of the divorce from
Catherine had not been quite settled,
and as it was just possible that his
two wives might clash, he resolved
to hurry on his legal separation
from her, whom we may call, by
way of distinction, the " old
original." Cranmer, who was a very
spaniel in his sneaking
subservience to his royal master, was
instantly set on to worry, as a cur
worries a cat, the unhappy
Catherine. A court was immediately
constituted, under the presidentship
of Cranmer, to decide on the legality
of her marriage, and the lady was

cited to appear; but she did not attend, and though summoned by
her judges fifteen times, the more they kept on calling, the more
she kept on not coming. Difficult as it is in general to anticipate
what a judicial decision will be, the judgment in the case of the
King ex parte Anne Boleyn versus Catherine of Aragon might be
foreseen very easily. The marriage was of course pronounced illegal,
and Cranmer wrote to Henry on the 12th of May, 1533, to say that
he had just had the pleasure of pronouncing the " old lady " vere et
manifesto contumax. The Court declared she had never been married
to Henry, but was the widow of the Prince of Wales, to whose title
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P104_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 81 -->
she must in future restrict herself. When the news was brought to
her she exclaimed indignantly, "Not married to the king! marry
come up, indeed ! " and the wretchedness of the pun speaks volumes
for the misery to which she had been reduced by her enemies.


Henry, wishing to make the work complete, and aware that finis
coronas opus, determined that a coronation should be the finishing
touch of his recent matrimonial manœuvring. The ceremony was
performed with great pomp, on the ist of June, 1533; when, though
the regular crown was used, the weak head of Anne was too feeble
to bear it, and it was replaced by a smaller diadem, which had been
purposely prepared as a substitute. When Clement heard of what
had been passing in England, he sent forth a bull, expecting that
Henry would be immediately cowed by it. The pontiff ordered the
monarch to take back his original wife, but the latter refused to
listen to any motion for returns; observing, that those who are at
Rome may do as Rome does, but that he should entirely repudiate
the papal jurisdiction. A parliament which was held soon after,
seconded the sovereign's views, and, by way of paying off the pope,
he was deprived of all fees, rights, and privileges which he had
hitherto enjoyed as head of the Church of England. The
ecclesiastical party in England had been subservient to the whim of Henry,
and had assisted in nullifying its own supremacy over the state,
by cutting off its own head; so that the experiment of amputating
one's own nose to be revenged upon one's face was somewhat more
than realised.


On the 7th of September, 1533, Anne Boleyn became the mother
of a little girl, who was named Elizabeth, and the courtiers of the
day already offered to lay heavy bets on the future greatness of
Betsy. The king, who had buoyed himself up with hopes of a
boy, was a little angry at the unfavourable issue, and he vented his
ill-humour in further insults towards the unfortunate Catherine.
Every one who continued, either by design or accident, to call her
queen, was thrown into prison; and even a slip of the tongue,
occasioned by absence of mind, was followed by absence of body, for
the luckless offender was dragged off to gaol, from the bosom of
his family.

Henry having lopped off Catherine as a branch of the royal tree,
and grafted Anne Boleyn on the trunk, began to think about the
successional crops, in the treatment of which he was assisted by a
servile parliament. Little Mary, the daughter of Catherine, was
rooted out like a worthless marigold, and Elizabeth was declared to
be the rising flower of the royal family. Among the atrocitiescomBirth os the Princess Elizabeth.

mitted by parliament on account of its miserable subserviency to the
will of the king, was the bill of attainder of high treason, passed
against a female fanatic called the Maid of Kent, and some of her
accomplices. This person, whose name was Elizabeth Barton, and
who resided at Aldington in Kent, was subject to hysterical fits, as
well as to talking like a fool, which in those days—as in these—was
often mistaken for a symptom of superior sagacity. Extremes are
said to meet, and the mental imbecility of Miss E. Barton was
thought by many to border on an amount of wisdom, which only
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P106_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 83 -->
inspiration could impart, and the semi-natural got credit for the
possession of supernatural attributes. Some of her idiotic and
incoherent talk having been heard by her ignorant companions, was
declared by them to be inspired, because it was something they did
not understand; and as knavery is always ready to turn to profit the
idea that folly sets on foot, persons were soon found willing to take
the Maid of Kent under their patronage for political purposes.


Richard Maister or Masters, the vicar of the place, whom Hume
calls " a designing fellow " behind his back, whatever the historian
might have said to the reverend gentleman's face, was the first to
take an interest in Elizabeth Barton, and introduced her to public
notice as a sort of mesmeric prodigy; in which capacity she brought
out a bundle of Sibylline leaves, with the intention, probably, of
making a regular business of telling fortunes. Anxious for the
recommendation of being able to announce herself as " Prophetess
in Ordinary to the King," Miss Barton began predicting all sorts of
things with reference to Henry; but unfortunately she had not the
tact to make his Majesty the subject of happy auguries. She hoped,
perhaps, that if she went to work boldly, he would buy her off; for it
has sometimes proved a good speculation to establish a nuisance in a
respectable neighbourhood, which will often pay the annoyance to
remove itself to some other locality. Miss Barton did not, however,
manage so well, for instead of getting literally bought up, she was
destined to be put down very speedily. Making a bold bid for royal
patronage, she prophesied that if Henry put away Catherine he would
die a violent death within seven months; and Elizabeth Barton thus
made sure that if the king declined treating with her for the stoppage
of her mouth, the ex-queen would at least make her some compliment
in return for her complimentary prophecy. Henry, who had no
objection to her dealing out death either wholesale, retail, or even for
exportation, to some of his popish enemies abroad, could not allow
such a liberty to be taken with his own name; and accordingly the
fortune-teller, who professed to hold consultation with the stars, was
brought up before the Star Chamber. She soon found in the
president a Great Bear more terrible than the Ursa Major to whom she
had been accustomed; and perceiving by the rough manner of the
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 84 -->
assembled stars of the Star Chamber, that theirs was anything but
the Milky Way, she was glad to own herself an impostor, for she saw
that it would have been useless to plead not guilty, before judges
who, according to her own conviction, were resolved on convicting
her. She was committed to prison on her own confession; and as
the seven months within which Henry would have become due,
according to her prediction of his death, had expired, it was to be
hoped that he, at least, would have been satisfied without subjecting
Miss Barton to further punishment. He however seemed to have
become positively irritated at the falsehood of her prophecy; and
because he had not died in the proper course, he subjected the maid
and six accomplices to a bill of attainder of treason, in pursuance of
which they were all executed on the 21st of April, 1534, at Tyburn.


We will not dwell on the disgusting subject of Henry's cruelties
towards such excellent men as Fisher, bishop of Rochester, and Sir
Thomas More, both of whom fell victims to the ferocity of their royal
master. Their conscientious refusal to recognise Henry as the head
of the Church had excited his rage, which increased to the height of
savageness when the pope offered to send to poor Fisher the hat of a
cardinal. The king at first attempted to put a prohibition on the
importation of all hats : but anticipating that the chapeau intended
for Fisher might be smuggled into England, Henry contented
himself with a barbarous joke, that the hat would be useless without a
head to wear it on. The monarch soon carried out his threat, and
then turned his fury upon the unfortunate Sir Thomas More, who had
retired into private life in the hope of escaping Henry's tyranny.
This, however, was impossible; for though conscience must often
have whispered, " Can't you leave the man alone r" some evil genius
kept ever and anon murmuring the words, " At him again," into the
ears of the despot.


Among the petty persecutions to which More was exposed, was
the taking away of all writing implements from the good old man,
who, deprived of pens and ink, took a coal as a substitute. He at
length learned to write with a piece of Wall's End as rapidly as he
could use a pen, and, with a coal-scuttle for an inkstand, he never
wanted the material to keep alive the fire of his genius. Considering
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 85 -->
how famous he was for the use of " words that burn," we do not see
how he could have found a better instrument than a piece of coal for
transcribing his sentiments. A pretext was soon found for taking the
life of this excellent man, whose facetious bearing at his own
execution shall not mislead us into unseemly levity in alluding to it.
He made jokes upon the scaffold; but we must admit that they are
of so sad and melancholy a description, as to be scarcely considered
inappropriate to his very serious position. So much has been said of
the wit of More, that we may perhaps be excused for hazarding a
word or two concerning it. Judging by some of the bon mots that
have been preserved, they seem to us hardly worth the expense of
their keep; for as horses are said to have eaten off their own heads,
so the witticisms of More appear in many instances to have consumed
all their own point, or, at all events, the rust of ages has a good deal
dimmed their brilliancy. His wife had but little respect for his
waggery, and would sometimes ask him " how he could play the fool
in a close, filthy prison ?" and she evidently thought it was carrying
a joke a little too far, when she found her husband would not " drop
it" even in the Tower. His allusion to his being obliged to write
with coals instead of pens, which caused him to say that " he was but
a wreck of his former self, and had better be scuttled at once," seems
to us equally deficient in point and dignity. He was executed on the
6th of July, 1535, after a quantity of badinage with the headsman,
which makes us regret, for the sake of More, that any reporters were
allowed to be present.


Henry had now come to open war with the Church of Rome, and,
under the advice of Cromwell, he determined to make a profit as well
as a pleasure of the recent rupture. While the pope let loose his
bulls upon the king, the latter turned out his bull-dogs, in the shape
of emissaries, empowered to pillage the rich monasteries in England.
Cromwell acted as whipper-in to this cruel sport, and hounded on the
servile dogs at his command, in pursuit of those monastic herds,
which had been luxuriating in the rich pastures the church had
hitherto afforded. It is true that many impositions on the public
were discovered by the emissaries of Henry; but one fault does not
justify another, and the frauds of the monks afforded no excuse for
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 86 -->
  
  [Book V.

the robbery committed by the monarch. We may feel indignant at
the showman who exhibits on his delusive canvas " more, much
more," than his caravan can hold, but we have no right to
appropriate to ourselves the whole of his stock because- he has been
guilty of trickery. Henry did not pocket, the whole of the proceeds
thus unscrupulously obtained, but gave a few slices to the church,
by creating half-a-dozen new bishoprics and establishing a
professorship or two in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The
greedy cry of " Give us a bit," which was raised by his clerical tools,
could not be altogether disregarded, and he threw them a few crumbs
of the good things he had seized, more with the hope of stopping the
mouths than satisfying the appetites of the hungry claimants.


Poor Catherine of Aragon died at Kimbolton on the 8th of
January, 1536, after writing a letter to the king, which if is said
extracted one tear from the sovereign's heart—a circumstance which
must have raised hopes at the time, that the process of extracting
blood from a stone might not be found impossible.


The year 1536 was marked by a voyage of discovery under the
patronage of the king, for the purpose of sending some emigrants on
a wild-goose chase to the north-west coast of America. Thirty of
the adventurers were gentlemen from the Temple and Chancery
Lane, who, thinking anything better than nothing, had probably
dashed their wigs to the ground, and thrown themselves on the
mercy of that motion of course which the sea was certain to supply
them with. It is said, though we know not with how much truth,
that the learned wanderers, being short of provisions, made each
other their prey—a result to be expected when clients were not
accessible. It is added that none of the party returned but a
learned gentleman of the name of Ruts, who was so changed that
his father and mother did not know him until he pointed to a wart
which had not been washed away by the water.


Henry continued his hostility to the pope, absurdly declaring
that he would not be bullied, and in defiance of the papal see caused
Anne Boleyn, who is said to have exulted over the death of Catherine,
to drain the cup of sorrow, or rather to lap it up j for she one day
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 87 -->
found Jane Seymour, a maid of honour, sitting on the knee of Henry.
It was in vain that the monarch and his new favourite endeavoured
to laugh the matter off as a mere lapsus, for Anne declared that the
king must have begun to nurse a new passion.  
  
  
  Henry la determined not to be bullied.


As they who are convicted of a fault themselves are anxious to
pick holes in the conduct of others, Henry having been proved to see
more in Seymour than became him as a married man, commenced
harbouring suspicions against Anne Boleyn. On May-day, 1536,
there had been a royal party at Greenwich—in fact, a regular fair—
when suddenly, in the midst of the sports, Henry started up
exceedingly indignant at something he had witnessed. The queen did the
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P111_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 88 -->
same, and her husband pretended that he had seen her either
winking at one Norris, a groom, or clown to the ring, in which the
jousts were going forward, or making signals to Mark Smeaton, a
musician in the orchestra. Several persons were seized at once, and
sent to the Tower, including poor Smeaton, the member of the band,
who was accused of acting in concert with men of higher note, to
whom he was charged with playing second fiddle.


Poor Anne was taken to the Tower, where a number of
scandalous old women were sent about her to talk her into admissions
against herself, and to talk her out of anything that they could
manage to extract from her simplicity. She wrote what may justly
be called " a very pretty letter" to the king, dated the 6th of May,
1536; but if any answer was received it must have come from Echo,
who is the general respondent to all communications which receive
no attention from the parties to whom they are directed. On the
12 th of the same month Norris, Weston, Brereton, and Smeaton
were tried and executed, all denying their guilt but the musician,
who changed his key-note a little before he died, and modulated off
from a fortissimo declaration of innocence to a most pianissimo
confession. There is every reason to believe that this composition of
Smeaton was a piece of thorough base, which is only to be accounted
for on the score of treachery.


On the 15 th of May, a building as trumpery as the charge against
her having been knocked together in the Tower, Anne Boleyn was
brought up for trial before a court of twenty-six barons, one of whom
was her own father, while her uncle the Duke of Norfolk sat as
president. One would have imagined that a jury comprising two
relatives would have given a positive advantage to Anne; but her
uncle being a rogue, and her father a fool, the former was too venal,
and the latter too timid, to be of any use to her. She pleaded her
own cause with such earnestness, that every one who heard how she
had acquitted herself, thought that her judges must have acquitted
her. They, however, found her guilty, to the intense bewilderment of
the Lord Mayor, who had heard her defence, and could only go
about exclaiming, " Well, I never! did you ever ?" for the remainder
of his existence.
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 89 -->

It would seem that there was something in the mere prospect of
the axe, which imparted its sharpness to the intellects of those upon
whose heads the instrument was on the point of falling. We have
already alluded to the mots of More when he was positively,
moribund, and the quips of the queen became very numerous and
sparkling as the prospect of the scaffold opened out to her. She

made a sad joke upon the little span of her own neck—in reference,
no doubt, to the small span of human existence—and paid a
compliment to foreign talent by requesting that she might have the
benefit of the services of that sharp blade that had just come from
Calais—alluding to the recent arrival of the French executioner.


Henry was on a hunting party in Epping Forest, and was
breakfasting on Epping sausages, when the execution took place, the
announcement of which he had ordered should be made to him by
the firing of a gun as a distant signal. During the dejeuner Henry  
  
  
  VOL. II.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P113_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 90 -->
kept continually exclaiming " hush," and entreating " silence," with
all the energy of an usher in a court of law, until a loud bang
boomed over the breakfast-table. Henry instantly started up,
exclaiming, " Ha, ha! 'tis done!" and ordering the dogs to be let slip
while his breakfast-cup was still at his lip, he resumed his sport with
even more than his wonted gaiety. On the very next day, he was
married to Jane Seymour, there having been a very short lapse of
time since she was discovered on the lap of Henry.


A parliament having been speedily assembled, that servile body
passed every act that Henry desired, and began by cancelling, in
one batch, the entire issue of his former marriages. The princesses
Mary and Elizabeth were declared illegitimate, while the
condemnation of Anne Boleyn was legalised by statute; a measure
which was a little tardy, considering that she had already lost
her head in pursuance, or rather in anticipation of the confirmation
of her sentence.


The destruction of monasteries was now carried on with a most
brutal rapacity, and a mixture of barbarism and barbarity that
disgusted a great portion of the community. Not satisfied with
robbing the inmates of the monasteries, Henry's myrmidons
destroyed the buildings themselves with the most wanton violence,
and it was remarked that they were never contented with emptying
a cellar of all its wine, but must always remain to take shots at the
bottles. This unprovoked and tasteless taste for mere mischief
roused the discontent of the people in many places, and the
Lincolnshire fens assumed the offensive, with one Mackrel, an odd fish, as
the leader of the insurgents. This Mackrel soon got himself into a
sad pickle, for he was executed at a very early period of the
insurrectionary movement.


On the 12th of October, 1537, Her Majesty Queen Seymour gave
birth to a son, an event which made Henry as happy as a king, or at
least as happy as such a king, with such a conscience as Henry
carried about with him, could possibly make himself. He dandled
the royal infant in his arms with all a parent's pride, and sang
snatches of nursery ballads in the ear of the baby. The child was

called Edward, which Henry fondly translated into Teddy Peddy;
and three little coronets—the size of first caps—were instantly made
for the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cornwall, and the Earl of
Chester, for such was the triafuncta in uno formed by the birth of the
illustrious little stranger. The queen died in twelve days after giving
birth to an heir; but this circumstance did not seem to affect the

spirits of Henry, who perhaps felt that there was one more wife out
of the way, without the trouble and expense of getting rid of her.


The arbitrary monarch now experienced a good deal of trouble
from one Pole, whom the tyrant made several attempts to bring to
the scaffold. This Pole was remarkable for standing erect, and for
his firmness, after once taking his ground, in keeping his position.
He was the son of Sir Richard Pole and Margaret, Countess of
Salisbury, for the first Pole was a kind of leaping Pole, with a strong
tendency to raise not only himself, but all those that belonged to him.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P117_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 92 -->
Reginald, for such was the name of the Pole that had stirred up the
rage of Henry, had received from the pope a cardinal's hat, with
the assurance that such a Pole ought not to be bare, but deserved the
most honourable covering. Being himself resident abroad, he was
as much out of the English tyrant's power as if he had been the old
original North Pole, of whom we have all heard; but his brothers
and relatives at home were seized upon, and either executed or burnt
like so much firewood. Parliament'aided the' despotism of the king,
by passing a suicidal act, declaring that a royal proclamation should
have the force of law; a resolution equivalent to an act of
selfdestruction; for if the king could do everything by himself, there
was, of course, no occasion for Lords and Commons to help him in
the task of government.


Henry having become disembarrassed of no less than three wives,
began to think so little of the encumbrance of matrimony, that he
contemplated a fourth engagement. It was indeed natural enough
that he should be fearless of that which might make bolder men
afraid, for he had given evidence of a facility in making an escape,
and he consequently risked little by braving danger. He advertised,
as it were, for a wife, in all the markets of European royalty, and he
continued popping a series of questions; but his—to revive a mot (we
cannot call it a ion mot) of the period—was of all pops the most
unpopular. " Nobody will have me, by Jingo," he would sometimes
mutter to himself; and at length the wily Cromwell proposed to act
as matrimonial agent to his Majesty.


The Duchess Dowager of Milan was treated with for her hand, but
she wrote back to say that if she had a couple of heads, she might
listen to Henry's proposal, for he would certainly cut off one, and it
would be awkward not having another head to fall back upon. He
next sent an offer to the Duchess of Guise, saying that wedlock,
coming to him in such a Guise, would be the height of happiness;
but this lady politely excused herself, on the ground of a" previous
engagement." Somewhat hurt by these repeated rebuffs, he requested
Francis the king of France to " trot out " his two sisters for Henry to
take his choice; but Frank said frankly that he would have nothing
to do with the humiliating business. We have it on the authority of
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 93 -->
a letter among Cromwell's correspondence, that Henry was rather
taken with Madame de Montreuil, a French lady, who having come
from France to Scotland in the suite of Magdalen, first queen of
James V. of Scotland, was now on her way back again. Henry
appears to have gone to Dover for the purpose of meeting her on the
pier or the parade; but he must have found her passce as he surveyed
her through his glass, for nothing came of their meeting. The lady
lingered in England to give him every chance, but Henry could only
shake his head, observing " No ! by Jove it won't do; " and Madame
de Montreuil, pitying his want of taste,'was compelled to return to
her own country.


At length Cromwell came running one morning to Henry,
exclaiming, " I think I've found something to suit your majesty at
last," and placed in the king's hand the card of " Anne, second
daughter of John Duke of Cleves, one of the princes of the Germanic
Confederacy." Henry was not positively averse to the match, but
was wavering, when Cromwell produced a lovely portrait as that of
the candidate for the hand of the English sovereign. The king
examined the picture with the eye of a connoisseur, and being pleased
with the sample, ordered the lot to be sent over to him with as little
delay as possible. The picture was by Holbein, who had utterly
concealed the plain fact, and bestowed upon the German princess
such handsome treatment, that he had imparted the lustre of the
brilliant to an object which was as inferior to the copy, as German
paste is worthless by the side of the diamond. Henry hastened, on
her arrival in England, to compare the original with the picture;
and having disguised himself, sent forward Sir Anthony Brown to
say that a gentleman was coming on to see her, with a new year's
present. Poor Brown was fearfully taken aback at seeing a lady so
thoroughly laide as Anne of Cleves, but gave no opinion to his royal
master. Henry went tripping into the apartment with all the ardour
of a youthful lover; but the first glance was enough, and he shrunk
back, muttering to himself, that the princess instead of looking like
the picture of Holbein, reminded him rather of the picture of misery.
He nevertheless summoned up all his resolution to give her a kiss;
but it was clear to all who witnessed the scene, that Henry repented
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 94 -->
a bargain in which he found himself mixed up with such a decidedly
ugly customer. After a few minutes passed in small-talk—the
smallness of which limited it to twenty words—Henry went away in
deep dudgeon, but he made up his mind to the marriage, lest he
might be involved with any of the German powers in an action for
a breach of promise.


The evening before the nuptials were solemnised, Henry sat with
Cromwell, bewailing—probably over some nocturnal grog—the
\"alarming sacrifice," that had become unavoidable. The statesman,
who had recommended the match, tried hard to soften down some of
the most repulsive features of Anne; but Henry coarsely described
her as "a great Flanders mare," and Holbein as a "humbug" for
having so grossly flattered such a coarse, clumsy animal. " By my
troth," he exclaimed—for his indignation rose as the liquor in his
glass became lower—" you got me into this scrape and you must get
me out of it. I shall expect you to find some means of abating for
me this frightful nuisance."


Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, the head of the popish party in
the church, was, of course, an opponent of Cromwell, and took
advantage of the recent matrimonial mistake, to damage him still
further in the opinion of his royal master. Gardiner flattered himself
that the train had been already laid, and that the awfully bad match
which Cromwell himself had provided, would certainly hasten the
explosion that there was good reason to anticipate. The wily Bishop
of Winchester introduced Catherine Howard, the lovely niece of his
friend the Duke of Norfolk, to the king, who was instantly struck by
her beauty, and said warmly, " Ha! the man who has discovered this
charming Kate knows how to cater for his sovereign." *


Cromwell's doom was now sealed, and the Duke of Norfolk, on
the ioth of June, 1540, had the luxury of taking into custody his
political antagonist. A charge of having one day pulled out a
dagger, and declared he would stick to the cause of the Reformation,
even against the king, was speedily got up, and, by the 28th of July,
he was disposed of, at Tower Hill, in the customary manner.  
  
  
  * Strype—who certainly deserves a hundred stripes for recording such an atrocity.
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 95 -->
While in prison, he wrote a pitiful letter to Henry, with the word
\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! " reiterated thrice as a P.S.; the
meanness and tautology of which evinced a poverty in the spirit as well as
in the letter.


The king had now determined to marry Catherine Howard, but
the old difficulty—another wife living—stood in the way of the
desired arrangement. Having consulted his attorney, it was
proposed to search for some previous marriage contract in which Anne
of Cleves had been concerned; and as everybody is engaged, on an
average, at least half-a-dozen times before being married once, there
would have appeared little difficulty in accomplishing Henry's wishes.


The excessive ugliness of Anne of Cleves, however, placed great
obstacles in the way, for she had clearly been a drug in the
matrimonial market, and neither by hook nor by crook could an old offer
for her be fished up until something of the kind from the young
Prince of Lorraine—entered into before he was old enough to
know better—was happily hit upon. A commission was at once
issued, the matter tried, and of course decided in Henry's favour.
By way of strengthening the king's case, it was urged by his learned
counsel that he had married against his will, and therefore ought
to be released from his contract. The Court, however, held that
the establishment of such a principle would be almost equivalent to
the passing of a general divorce act for half the couples in
Christendom, and on that point at least the rule for a new trial of Henry's
luck was refused accordingly. His suit for a nullification of his
contract with Anne of Cleves succeeded on the other point, and both
parties were equally gratified by the result which set them both at
liberty. The lady felt she had much rather lose her husband's hand
than her own head, and Henry began to think he might be wearing
out the axe upon his wives before he had half done with it, and if he
could find any other means for severing the marriage tie he much
preferred doing so. He offered to make her his sister, with three
thousand a year, an arrangement with which she expressed herself
perfectly satisfied. Both parties were permitted to enter into
wedlock again, if they pleased, and the king of course availed himself of
the option with his accustomed celerity. The Bill was brought into
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 96 -->
Parliament on the 12th of July, and the 8th of August found
Catherine Howard already publicly acknowledged as the fifth Mrs.
Henry Tudor.


It had now become the boast of Henry that he held the balance
with an even hand between the Catholics and the Reformers; but
his impartiality was shown in a manner most inconvenient to both of
them. He used to deal out what he called equal justice to both, by
submitting a few on each side of the question to equal cruelty. He
would forward three Catholics at a time to Smithfield, to be hanged
as traitors, and by the same hurdle he would send three Lutherans
to be burned as heretics.


As we are unwilling to turn our history into a Newgate Calendar,
for the sake of recording the atrocities of a sanguinary king, we
shall, in our account of the remainder of this odious reign, preserve
the heads, and avoid the executions. The murder of the Countess
of Salisbury, an old woman upwards of seventy, and the mother of
Cardinal Pole, stands out perhaps from some other sanguinary deeds
by its peculiar atrocity. The venerable lady, at the last moment,
defied the executioner to come on, and a combat of the fiercest
character took place upon the scaffold.


Henry, who had frequently tried to inoculate his nephew, James V.
of Scotland, with his own predatory propensities, became at length
angry that the latter declined turning thief in the name of religion,
and plundering the church under the pretext of simply reforming it.
A conference had been agreed upon between the English and Scotch
kings; but the latter, at the instigation of Cardinal Beaton, whose
olfactory nerves had detected a rat, broke his appointment with his
imperious uncle. This ungentlemanly proceeding gave such offence
to the English tyrant, that he threatened, with an awful oath, to let
the weight of old Henry be felt in Scotland; and the expression that
So-and-so purposes " playing old Harry," no doubt took its rise from
the incident to which we have alluded.


The Duke of Norfolk was sent, as a low fellow of the period hath
it, " to take the shine out of that Jem," who was completely defeated
at Solway Moss, through his own troops turning their backs—not
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 97 -->
upon him, as it is said by some, but upon the enemy. James was so
overwhelmed with shame and despair, that he drew his helmet over
his eyes, assumed a stoop—a sure sign that he was stupefied—and
never raised his head again, but fell a victim to that very vulgar
malady, a low fever. He left his kingdom to his daughter, then only
eight days old, who came to the throne on the ninth; but as she was
not a nine days' wonder, she evinced no miraculous aptitude for the
task of government.


Henry had in the meantime been made very uncomfortable by
rumours that his wife, familiarly known as Miss Kate Howard, had
not been acting properly. When the king heard the news, he was
deeply affected, for he was one of those persons who make up, in
feeling for themselves, for their deficiency of feeling with regard to
others. He sat down and had a good crocodilian cry, which irrigated
his hands to such an extent that he was compelled to wring them
to get them dry again. Cranmer and Norfolk were appointed to
examine into the truth of the charges against the queen, who, when
her guilt was proved beyond doubt, made a virtue of necessity—the
only virtue of which she could boast—by boldly confessing it.


This unfortunate young woman had been promised a pardon on
condition of her revealing the extent of her transgression; but when
she had admitted not only a great deal she had done, but had thrown
into the bargain a great deal she had never done at all, Henry,
regardless of his pledge, thought that the best way to get rid of an
annoyance was to break the neck of it. Catherine Howard was
accordingly beheaded at the Tower, on the 15th of February, 1542,
and finding her confession had done her no good, she retracted the
greater part of it. " It was not to be supposed," says Mullins, " that
a person who had shown himself so double as Henry, could long
remain single," and he accordingly threw himself once more upon
the matrimonial market. There he was of course no longer at a
premium, but he was pretty soon at Parr; and it is a strange fact
that he would have commanded a better price had it been certain
that he could be had without the coupon, which had distinguished
the settling days of two of the wives of this shocking bad sovereign.
Catherine Parr was a corpulent old lady, fortified by at least forty  
  
  
  VOL. II. °
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 98 -->
summers, but she readily listened to the proposals of Henry. Henry
entered her at once on his share or chore list, and in allusion to her
bulk, placed opposite to her name the words "commands a very
heavy figure." She was the widow of Neville, Lord Latimer; but,
thought Henry, " What care I, if she has even killed her man ?—it
will not be the first time that I shall have killed my woman."


The English king courted her at once, and made much of her;
but to have made more of her than there really was, would have
been rather difficult. He married her on the ioth of July, 1543, and
it is a curious fact that she outlived him, which we can only attribute
to the lady partaking the longevity of her namesake old Parr, for
there must have been a vigorous adhesion to life in any one who
could marry and survive the wife-exterminating tyrant. For some
time she humoured Henry, but having a touch of Lutherism, she
began meddling with matters of Church and State, which embroiled
her with a bishop or two, who ran and told the king what she had
been impudent enough to talk about. " Marry come up ! " roared
Henry, in allusion to his having elevated Catherine Parr by marrying
her; " so you are a doctor, are you, Kate ? " But having had a hint
that her mixing in politics was not agreeable, she only replied,
meekly, " No, no, your Kate is no caitiff." This speech had the
effect of diverting Henry's wrath, almost as much as it will divert
posterity by its delightful quaintness. Gardiner, who had justified
his name — allowing of course for the difference of spelling—by
sowing the seeds of dissension between the king and queen, had
arranged with the sovereign that Her Majesty was to be seized next
morning by forty guards, headed by Chancellor Wriothesley. This
person was not a little astonished at finding himself called " an
arrant knave, a foole, and a beastlie foole," * by the king, when he
came to execute his mission. He was, in fact, dismissed with an
entire earful of fleas, of which Henry had always an abundance on
hand for unwelcome visitors.


Henry had now become, literally, the greatest monarch that ever
sat upon the throne, for he had increased awfully in size, and become  
  
  
  * Lord Herbert.

irritable at the same time, so that the task of getting round him was,
in every sense, extremely difficult. Had there been a prize monarch
show, open to the whole world, he must have carried off the palm, for
he was too fat to lie down, lest no power should be able to get him
up again. It is true he had been born to greatness, but he also had

greatness thrust upon him—some say by over-feeding—to such an
extent that he was obliged to be wheeled about, on account of his
very unwieldiness. It might have been supposed that Henry
would have begun to soften under all these circumstances; but he
exhibited no tendency to melt, for he continued his cruelties in
burning those whom he chose to denounce as heretics. It is
disgraceful to the ecclesiastical character of the age, that the church
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P125_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 100 -->
party that happened to be in power sanctioned the cruelties
practised towards the party that happened to be out, and it was
said, at the time, that the fires of Smithfield were always being
stirred by some high clerical dignitary, who might be considered the
"holy poker" of the period.


The prospect of a speedy vacancy on the throne, created a rush of
candidates, who commenced literally cutting each other's throats—a
desperate game, in which the Howards and Hertfords made
themselves very conspicuous. Young Howard, Earl of Surrey, used to
sneer at Hertford, who had been recently ennobled, as a " new man,"
and Hertford would retort unfeelingly upon Howard's father, the
Duke of Norfolk, by saying " it was better to be a new man than an
old sinner." The Norfolk family got the worst of it, for Norfolk and
Surrey were taken to the Tower on the 12th of December, 1546, on
the frivolous charge of having quartered with their own arms the
arms of Edward the Confessor. Had they gone so far as to use
these arms upon a seal, it ought not to have sealed their doom, nor
stamped them as traitors; but the frivolousness of the charge marks
the tyrannical character of the period. Commissioners were sent to
their country seat at Kuming Hall, to ransack the drawers, pillage
the plate-chest, and send the proceeds to the king; but the people
intrusted with the job, either found or pretended to find scarcely
anything. They wrote to the king, telling him that the jewels were
all either sold or in pawn; but as the tickets never came to hand, it
is possible that the searchers were practising a sort of duplicate
rascality. They forwarded to the king a box of beads and buttons; but
though every bead was glass, Henry does not appear to have seen
through it. Surrey was tried at Guildhall for having quartered
the royal arms with his own, and on his defence he observed, " By
my troth, mine enemies will not allow me any quarter whatever."
He was found guilty, of course, and beheaded on the 19th of
January, 1547, and his father's execution had been set down in the
peremptory paper for the 28th of the same month, when the
proceedings were suddenly stayed, just before execution, by the
death of Henry.  
  
  
  The tyrant, who had been getting physically as well as morally
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 101 -->
worse and worse, clung to life with such desperate tenacity, that is a
sure sign of there being good reason for dreading death in those
among whom, after a certain age, such a cowardly fear is manifest.
He would often impiously threaten that " he would outlive all the
younger people about him yet; " and though his time was evidently
not far off, he would not bear to be told of his true condition.
Instead of repenting of his past life, he devoted the wretched
remnant of his existence to doing all the mischief he could, and venting
his malice to the fullest extent that his now failing strength would
admit of. Nobody dared muster resolution to tell the unhappy old
brute that he must very speedily die, until Sir Anthony Denny, a
knight who shared our friend Drummond's * aversion to humbug of
any description, boldly told old Harry that he was on the point of
visiting his redoubtable namesake.


Finding all chance of escape cut off, he began confessing his sins;
but it was rather too late, for, had his repentance been sincere, the
catalogue of his crimes was far too voluminous to allow of his getting
through one-half of it before his dissolution. He had been in the
habit of adjourning that court of conscience existing in his as well as
in every man's breast, and he always postponed it sine die; but
when the time to die actually came, or the die was really cast, it was
rather late to move for a new trial. Henry died on the 29th of
January, 1547, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, the thirty-eighth of
his reign, and at least the forty-first of his selfishness, baseness,
and brutality.


He had been married six times, having divorced two of his wives,
beheaded two more, and left one a widow. This leaves one more—
Jane Seymour—still unaccounted for; and indeed her death was the
most wonderful of all, because it was natural. He left behind him
three children: but he did not care a pin's head, or even—to name
an article of smaller importance to him—a wife's head, for any one
of them. Such a very bad man was sure to be a very bad father,
and he had declared two of his children illegitimate, for it was the
delight of this monster to depreciate his own offspring in the eyes of  
  
  
  * "Drummond is so averse to humbug of any description."—Vide Tiyou.
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 102 -->
the world as much as possible. His religious reforms, however
wholesome in their results, were brutal in their execution and base
in their origin. His insincerity may be gathered from the fact that
he appointed masses to be said for his own soul, though he had
burnt many persons for popery; and he seemed to think that, by
taking up two creeds at once on his death-bed, he could make up for
the utter irreligion of his past existence. He is said to have
contributed to the cause of enlightenment, and so perhaps he did with  
  
  
  hllllni ot Henry VII

all his blackness, as the coal contributes to the gas; and never
was a bit of Wall's End half so hard, or a tenth part so black, as
the heart of this despicable sovereign. He never had a friend; but
he was surrounded by sycophants, whom, one after the other, he
atrociously sacrificed.


Cranmer being a man of superior mind, exercised an influence
over him, and was sent for to his death-bed, when he pressed the
prelate's hand; but whether the pressure arose from cramp or
conscience, rheumatism or remorse, penitence or " pins and needles,"
must be considered a question to which we will not hazard an
answer. We regret that we have been unable to adhere to the
excellent motto, de mortuis nil nisi bonum, in this case; but Henry
was such a decided malum in se, that mischief was bred in the bone,
and the nil nisi bonum becomes impossible.


Learning certainly advanced in this reign, and Henry himself
affected authorship; but every literary man, from the highest flyer
in the realms of fancy to the humblest historian of last night's
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P128_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 103 -->
fire or yesterday's police, will be honestly ashamed of his royal
fellow-craftsman.


Several colleges and schools were founded in this reign, among
the principal of which were Christ Church at Oxford, Trinity at
Cambridge, and St. Paul's in London. Here it was that the lowly
Lily, of Lily's grammar notoriety, first raised his humble head as the
head master of the school; and, though there is something
lack-adaisy-cal in Lily's style, his grammar was at one time the first
round of the ladder by which every lad climbed the heights of
classical instruction.


It may be interesting to the gastronomic reader to be informed
that salads and turnips first came into use, with other roots, towards
which the people had shown until then a rooted antipathy. They
swallowed spinach without any gammon, and even the carrot, that
had formerly stuck in their throat as if they feared it would injure the
carotid artery, was consumed with alacrity; and those who had
disdained the most delicious of green food, by courageously exclaiming
\"Come, let us try it," are supposed by some—though we disclaim
the monstrous idea—to have given its name to the lettuce. The
cultivation of hops came as if with a hop, skip, and jump across from
Flanders, and the trade in wool was brought, under the fostering
patronage of Wolsey, to a state of some prosperity.


With the exception of the burning of monasteries and the murder
of his wives, there was little to render the reign of Henry remarkable,
beyond, perhaps, the invention of beef-eaters. The word beef-eater
is known to be a corruption of' buffetier; and indeed there was
corruption, to a certain extent, in everything connected with this detestable
tyrant. It is said they were called buffctiers from attending at the
buffets, or side-board of plate, but it is far more likely that they got
the name from the buffeting to which every servant of the royal
ruffian must have been occasionally liable. The neck was so often
in danger, that any menial of the malignant monarch might be
expected to ruff it in the best way he could, and hence the enormous
ruffs, which are conspicuous to this day, round the chins of the
beefeaters. The looseness of their habits may be considered
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 104 -->
characteristic of the court to which these functionaries were attached, though
it has been said by some authorities that the beef-eaters were puffed
and padded out to an enormous extent, in order that the monster
Henry might not appear conspicuous.


The reign of Henry was also remarkable for the invention of pins,
to which somebody had given his own head with intense earnestness.
The sharpness of the English had not yet reached so fine a point as
to have led to the discovery of the needle, which was doubtless
suggested by the pin, to some one who had an eye for improvement.
The thimble is a still later introduction, the merit of which is
considerable; for though at the present day every sempstress has the
thimble at her finger ends, there was a time when no one had
thought of this very simple but necessary appendage to the ladies'
work-table. If the reign of Henry had never been devoted to
anything more objectionable than the discovery of pins and needles, we
should have had little reason to complain, for a few pricks of
conscience, no matter whence they emanated, would have done him
good; but the scissors for cutting the thread of existence formed
the instruments chiefly in use during this cruel and most disastrous

reign.

a few days by his people.


The lamentations, whether sincere or hypocritical, were very soon
exchanged for joy at the accession of Edward the Sixth, who was
only in his tenth year when he woke one morning and found the
crown of England over his ordinary night-cap. To rub his eyes and
ask " What's this ?" were the work of an instant, when, taking off
the bauble, drawing aside his curtains, and holding the article up to
the light, he at once recognised the royal diadem.

Young Edward was what we should call a little forward chit had
he been a common lad, but being a king we must at once accept him
as an infant prodigy. He had learnt several tongues from Mr.
Cheke, and had been a pupil of Sir Anthony Cook; but many of
such cooks would have spoiled the best " broth of a boy," for Sir
Anthony was a pedant, " with five learned daughters "—being
equivalent to a couple of pair of blue stockings, and an odd one over.


Henry, in his reluctance to leave to his son what he could no
longer hold himself, had fettered the monarchy as much as he could
by his will, which was, however, soon treated with the contempt it
merited. He had appointed sixteen executors and twelve councillors,
but all to no purpose; for all power was placed in the hands of the
young king's uncle Hertford, who was created Duke of Somerset.
The vaulting ambition of this man, who turned Somersets over every
obstacle that fell in his way, rendered his new title very appropriate.
He was invested with the office of Protector, and he very soon set to
work, but, still true to his name of Somerset, he went head over
heels into a war with Scotland. The object of this proceeding was
to demand the hand of Mary, Queen of Scots, for the child Edward;
but the idea of a person coming to make love with a fleet of sixty
sail, and an army of 18,000 men, was a little trop fort to suit the taste
of the Caledonians. They placed a ban upon the marriage, which
was equivalent to forbidding the banns, and suggested, that if
the young gentleman wanted to come courting, he had better come
by himself to pay his addresses.


After a little negotiation, which ended in nothing, a battle
ensued, which is famous as the Battle of Pinkey, where the
combatants pinked each other off most cruelly with the points of
their swords; and it is added, by the inveterate Strype—who
deserves two thousand stripes, at least, for this offence—that
\"on this field, which was within half a mile of Musselburgh, the
soldiers on both sides strained every muscle." The English archers
sent their arrows from their bows with destructive effect; and
looking, as they did, like so many Cupids in a valentine, it must
be confessed that that mode of warfare was, at least, appropriate
to a war undertaken in the cause of Hymen. The Scotch were
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 107 -->
sadly defeated, but they still refused to give up their little queen
to the young fellow who sought her hand through his subjects'
arms, and she was accordingly sent to finish her education in
France; where, though only six years of age, she was betrothed to
the Dauphin.  
  
  
  Cngliah Archer ot the Period {from such a rare old print).


Somerset, instead of following up his successes, made the best of
his way home; for he heard that his own brother, Sir Thomas
Seymour, the Lord High Admiral, who had been created also Baron
Seymour of Sedley, was making himself a great deal too agreeable
to the royal ladies in England. Old Kitty Parr, Henry's widow, was
so much taken with Tom Seymour's attentions, that she fell at once
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P133_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 108 -->
into his arms, and became his wife; but poor Parr soon fell to a
discount in the eyes of her husband, who had become enamoured of the
young Princess Elizabeth. The unhappy old Parr swallowed many
a bitter pill at this time, until death put an end to her annoyances.
Admiral Seymour was now free to pay his addresses to Elizabeth, but
it would seem that he was not more free than welcome, for even
during the life of her mother-in-law, that young lady had afforded
him every encouragement.


In order to stop his flirtations, which were now becoming serious,
he was clapped in the Tower, but his enemies were considerate
enough to send a bishop to him to preach patience, and as Ely was
selected, who prosed exceedingly, the preaching was accompanied
by a practical lesson in patience, with which it is to be hoped that
Seymour was sufficiently edified. He was accused of treason, and at
a council the boy Edward, who had no doubt been crammed for the
occasion, delivered an elaborate judgment, which his parasites puffed
as extemporaneous. He regretted being obliged to sacrifice his
uncle Seymour to the common weal—a weal that has brought woe to
many, and to which the wheel of fortune bears, except in its
orthography, a wondrous similarity. Seymour was executed on
Wednesday, the 20th of March, 1549, and the last use he made of his head
before it was struck off was to shake it, and observe that " 'pon his
honour, if he had been guilty of any treason against the king it was
quite unintentional."


The country was about this time agitated by one of those fits of
general discontent which prevail every now and then among the
lower orders of society. As usual there was a good deal of reason
mixed with a large amount of unreasonableness in their complaints,
and the customary feeling of " not knowing exactly what they really
wanted," became alarmingly general. Some cried for this, another
for that, and another for t'other, while an almost universal shout for
the privilege of ruling themselves was accompanied by a clear
manifestation of an utter want of self-control on the part of the people.
Their self-styled friends were of course busy in goading them on to
acts of violence, and the protector himself, instead of repressing
tumult first, and pardoning it afterwards, pursued the opposite course,
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 109 -->
which only had the effect of clearing off old scores, that new might be
run up with fresh alacrity.


One of the most prominent ringleaders in the revolt was a tanner
of Norfolk, named Robert Ket, of whom it was vulgarly said, that
such a bob was as good as two tanners; " and hence perhaps," says
my Lord Herbert, or some one else, " two tanners or sixpences came
to be called in the vernacular equivalent to one bob, or a shilling."
Ket had been cruelly provoked in having the mob set upon one of
his inclosures by a gentleman who had suffered from the destruction
of one of his own hedges; but the tanner retaliated by administering
such a leathering to his assailants as they would have remembered
to this hour had any one of them been left alive to indulge in such
reminiscences. It was found necessary to send over to Scotland for
Warwick to go and settle Ket, which was very speedily done, for
finding himself unable to keep upon his legs, he laid down his arms,
after having run for his life, and crept into a barn among some corn,
to avoid an immediate thrashing. He was taken to Nonvich, and
lodged in the castle, whence he wrote to a friend, saying, " I shall
be hanging out for the present at the above address; " and his
words were soon verified, for he was hanged out on the top of the
building a few days afterwards.


Poor Somerset was now about to take the most formidable
somerset in the whole of his career, namely, a fall from the extreme
of power to the depths of disgrace, chiefly by the rivalry of Warwick.
The protector found it high time to think about protecting himself,
and tried to muster his friends, to many of whom he wrote; but
verbal answers of "Not at home," "Mr. So and So will send," and
similar evasive replies, convinced poor Somerset that there was very
little hope for him.


In the meantime Warwick and party were meeting daily at Ely
Place, Holborn, where they were settling in that very legal
neighbourhood the draft of a set of charges against the protector, who
was accused among other things of having pulled down a church in
the Strand to build Somerset House, and having spent in bricks
and mortar the money intrusted him to keep up the wooden walls
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 110 -->
of old England, by paying the sailors and soldiers their respective
salaries. A bill of pains and penalties was issued from Ely Place,
which is to this day famous for its art in making out bills, and
twenty-eight charges were brought against Somerset, who thought
it better to confess every one of them, on a promise that he should
be leniently dealt with. This leniency consisted in taking away
almost everything he possessed, which caused him to remonstrate
on the heaviness of the fine; but on being told snappishly he might
consider himself lucky in having got off with his life, he shrunk back
in an attitude of the utmost humility. He was set at liberty and
pardoned, but we shall have him at mischief and in trouble again
before the end of this chapter.


Though a mere child was on the throne, the atrocities committed
at Smithfield, in the burning of what were called heretics, went on as
briskly as ever, the fires being stirred by Cranmer and Ridley, in
the most savage manner. Mary, the king's eldest sister, gave
considerable trouble, by insisting on the celebration of mass in her own
household; and, though told by the council she mustn't, the truly
feminine reply " that she should see if she shouldn't," and "that she
would though—they'd see if she wouldn't," was all that she
condescended to say in answer to the requisition.


Somerset since his liberation had been still hanging about the
court, and had apparently become reconciled to Warwick, whose
eldest son, Lord Lisle, had been married to Lady Ann, one of the
daughters of the ex-protector. Nevertheless, on Friday, the 16th of
October, 1551, Somerset found himself once more in the " lock-up,"
on a charge of treason. He was accused of an intention to run
about London crying out " Liberty ! Liberty ! " and if that had not
succeeded he was to have gone to the Isle of Wight to try on the
same game in that direction. If that had not succeeded there is no
knowing what he would have done; but at all events, orders were
sent to the Tower to set a watch upon the great seal, because
Somerset wanted to run away with it. If he had made off with the
seal he might, perhaps, have taken the watch also; but this did not
occur to the council.  
  
  
  His trial took place at Westminster, on the 1st of December,
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 111 -->
1551, at the sittings after Michaelmas term, when he denied
everything, and was found guilty of just enough to get a judgment—
with speedy execution—against him. His politeness was quite
marvellous, for he thanked the lords who had tried him, and he
threw as much grace as he could into the bow he was compelled
to make on submitting his head to the axe of the executioner.
\"This," says Fox, on the authority of a nobleman who was present,
\"came off on Friday, the 22nd of January, 1552," and it is a curious
fact, that of every execution that occurred in his reign the boy king
had preserved the heads in his private journal.


Warwick, who had got himself promoted to the dukedom of
Northumberland, seemed desirous of making government a business
for the benefit of himself and family. He took the motto of "
anything for peace and quiet," though he had blamed his predecessor,
Somerset, for having done the same thing, and he bought off the
hostility of France and Scotland by selling Boulogne regularly up,
placing a carpet on the lighthouse, dividing the upper and lower
town into lots, declaring that he wanted money down on the nail,
and to hit the right one on the head he must resort to the hammer.
He made excellent marriages for his children, and allied his son,
Guildford Dudley, with the royal family of France, by wedding him
to Lady Jane Grey, a daughter of a son of the old original Mary
Tudor of France, to whose descendants the English crown would fall
in the event of a failure of a more direct succession.


The young king Edward, who had not yet passed through the
ordinary routine of infantine complaints, now took the measles—or
rather the measles took him—and he had scarcely recovered from
this complaint, when the small-pox placed him under indentures
which seemed much too strong to be cancelled within any reasonable
period. He was serving his time to this malady, when another
latent illness that had hitherto been playing at hide-and-seek, set
up a cry of " whoop," and his youthful majesty was in for the
whooping-cough. Northumberland, taking advantage of the king's
weak state, advised him not to leave the crown to his big and
bigoted sister Mary. "True," said Edward, "but how about poor
little Bet ?" " Why she," replied the protector, " is very little
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 112 -->
better." With such weak sophistry as this, he persuaded the poor
invalid king to draw up a settlement of the crown on Lady Jane
Grey, and the judges, with all the law officers, were summoned to
approve the document.  
  
  
  
The Duke os Northumberland ofsera to tight any one of them.


Sir Edward Montague, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,
with Sir Thomas Bromley, one of his puisnes, came accompanied by
the attorney and solicitor-generals, to say that the deed was illegal,
and that they, one and all, would have nothing to do with it. Upon
this, Northumberland rushed into the room, called Montague a traitor,*  
  
  
  * Burnet.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P138_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 113 -->
banged the door, threatened to bang the judges, and offered to fight
in his shirt-sleeves any one of them. He declared that if they
could not see the deed in its proper light, he would pretty soon beat
it into them, and he was squaring up to the poor puisne with an
evident intention for mischief, when the judges offered to take the
papers home and reconsider them.


The next day, they were again sent for, when, finding
Northumberland as pugilistic as ever, and hand in glove with the king, the chief
justice consented to the deed; and the puisne, on being approached
by Northumberland in an attitude of menace, was glad to stammer
out, " I am of the same opinion," as rapidly as he could give the
words their utterance. The judges were promised that the deeds
should be ratified by parliament, and that they should be pardoned,
if they had done wrong; for otherwise, from the fists of
Northumberland to the hands of the legislature, might have been analogous to
getting out of the frying-pan into the fire.


All this row in the palace of an invalid produced the effect that
might have been expected, for the poor boy died a day or two
afterwards. A pugilistic encounter between a duke and a judge, was
somewhat too much of a stimulant for a child in Edward's weak
state, and his physicians having given him up, he was turned over to
the treatment of a female quack, who finished him. She did the
business on the 6th of July, 1553, when he sunk under a complication
of evils, among which his medical attendant was undoubtedly the
greatest. He had lived fifteen years, eight months, and twenty-two
days, having been upon the throne six years and a half; affording a
curious instance of a reign, in which the part of the sovereign was so
insignificant that it might just as well have been omitted.


This little fellow has been greatly eulogised for his talents, as
shown in his journal; but on looking at this juvenile production we
regret to say that we could not go the length of our old friend the
evening paper, in stating that it is " a very remarkable production."
He mentions certain dinners and suppers with evident gusto, and
alludes to the return of the sweating sickness, but misses the obvious
point, that he hopes it will not prove so perverse as to begin sweating  
  
  
  VOL. II. Q
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 114 -->
sovereigns. Some of the historians of his reign allege that he had
studied the business of the Mint; but it may fairly be replied, that
merely looking at the process of coining does not make a sovereign.
He is said to have known all the harbours in Scotland, England, and
France, with the amount of water they were capable of containing
—and though this may prove the depth of his research, it is no
particular mark of his ability. He took notes of everything he
heard; but as sovereigns hear a great deal of thorough trash, the
collection must have been rather tedious and elaborate than
instructive or entertaining.


If we are to judge young Edward by the laws passed in his reign,
there is no great deal to be said for him. Beggars were declared
to be the slaves of those who apprehended them, and iron collars
were permitted to be put about the throats of the latter; but this
was too much for the pride of the stiff-necked people of England,
and the law was repealed, within two or three years of its having
been enacted.


There is no doubt that he was a most amiable little fellow, as
docile as a lamb, if indeed his gentleness did not amount to absolute
sheepishness. His flatterers say that he could speak five languages,
and had a taste for music and physic, in the latter of which
predilections we are quite unable to sympathise. We should have said
he was a nice child but for the peculiarity to which we have just made
allusion. As a quiet young gentleman at a preparatory school kept
by ladies, Master Edward Tudor would have done credit no doubt
to the establishment in which he might have been placed; but we
would as soon select a sovereign from a seminary at once, and take
him from the bread-and-butter to the throne, as see the spirit of the
monarchy diluted in milk-and-water, and the sceptre dwindling
down into a king's pattern spoon.

having got the deedappointing his daughter-in-law the Lady Jane  
  
  Grey to the throne, began to get rather
nervous as to the effect of making
known to the people such a
preposterous arrangement. He was afraid to
advertise the king's death, and walked
about the palace at Greenwich, biting
his nails, thinking what he should do,
or shut himself up in a small
apartment, which, from the colour of its
walls, was known as the brown study.
He subsequently sent for the Lord
Mayor of London, half-a-dozen
aldermen, and a dozen citizens, to whom he
communicated, one at a time, but
always in a whisper, the decease of the
sovereign. " Mind you don't tell," was
the precautionary observation he made  
  
  
  rlorthumberla nd  
  
  
  making a Speech

to each; and a will was then produced, in which the boy-king had
appointed Lady Jane Grey his successor. The Cockneys expressed
their readiness to swear allegiance to the lady, if it was " all right; "
and Northumberland pledged his honour as a peer, that he would
make it so. This happened on the 9th of July, and two days
afterwards Lady Jane was forwarded by water to the Tower of London,
some of the corporation, who had been gained over by her
father-inlaw, rowing in the same boat with her. After her safe arrival, the
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P141_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 116 -->
death of King Edward was publicly announced, and Lady Jane Grey
was proclaimed amid very slight applause, accompanied by murmurs
of the name of Mary. Poor Jane was sadly genie by the position into
which she was thrust, for she was a quiet, unaspiring, lovely creature,
whose only fault seems to have been that she read Plato in the
original Greek,* which appears to us the very alpha and omega of absurdity.


In the meantime, Mary, whose sanguinary disposition, and love
for cutting off heads in her father's style, fully entitled her to the
name of the " chip of the old block," was raising friends to resist the
views of Northumberland. Mary, whose catholic predilections were
known, promised those who were favourable to the Reformation,
that she would make no change in the religion fixed by Edward;
and thus, though she was understood to have mass celebrated at
home, she silenced the scruples of the masses. The proclamation
of Lady Jane Grey had been contrived at a packed meeting of the
council, on the ioth of July; but it is said that a vintner's lad—or
more probably a boy going round with the beer—entered a protest—
possibly through an open window—to the arrangement. A
policeman was instantly sent after him, and he was at once set in the
pillory, where the tops of his ears paid the penalty of a juvenile
offence, which he would not have committed had he arrived at the
years of discretion. This little incident, trifling as it was, showed
that there was a feeling abroad unfavourable to the elevation of
Jane; for the pot-boy is always an authority on the subject of public
measures. His opportunities of listening to the discussions of the
people are great; and though he may hear much frothy declamation,
as well as witness a vast tendency to half-and-half principles, in the
course of his experience, he is nevertheless capable of judging, to a
considerable extent, of the feelings of the multitude.


Northumberland, seeing that opinion was taking a powerful turn
in Mary's favour, became fearfully perplexed, and hearing that an
adverse force was being collected, came to the resolution that "
somebody " must go and oppose the enemy. Who that " somebody"
should be, was a very puzzling question, for Northumberland did not  
  
  
  * Roger Ascham.
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 117 -->
like the business himself, and was afraid to trust anyone else with a
matter of so much consequence. At length he offered the task to
Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey; but that young lady began to
cry very bitterly at the idea of her poor papa, who was " wholly
unaccustomed to public fighting," being sent into battle. Whether
it was an arrangement between father and daughter it is impossible
to say; but it is well known that Suffolk was not over valorous, and
even if he did not " cry off," Lady Jane did so for him, by keeping up
a constant cry until they found her father a substitute.
Northumberland, perceiving that Suffolk had made up his mind not to go, was
looking about him for somebody else, when a general interrogatory of,
\"Why don't he go himself? " seemed to suggest itself to the council.
With a reluctance that indicated the feeling in his mind of " Well, I
suppose I must," he started off with a small army, which experienced
a cold reception in its progress, and the silence of the spectators
giving them the air of mutes, invested with the dolefulness of a
funeral procession the march of the troops as far as Bury.


Northumberland had no sooner turned his back on the council
than they turned their backs on him, by proclaiming Mary as Queen
of England; and on a party being sent to besiege the Tower, Lady Jane
Grey, by the advice of her own papa, resigned all pretensions to the
sovereign dignity. Suffolk not only evinced no disposition to defend
his daughter's claims, but turning his sword into a steel pen, hastened
to sign the decrees that were being issued in the name of Mary.


Poor Northumberland, who was waiting for succours which never
came, and who was accordingly being victimised by the expenses of
his soldiers, who acted as suckers of a different kind, heard of what
had taken place in London, and having fallen back upon Cambridge,
sent for a herald, or town crier, with whom he bargained for the
proclamation of Mary, at the market-place. It has been atrociously
hinted, by an old offender, whose family we spare by the
suppression of his name, that Northumberland took this humiliating course
in the hope that Mary would be molli-fied. He had scarcely finished
the proceeding we have described, when he received a sharp letter
from the council in London, desiring him to disband his army; but
looking round, he perceived that it had disbanded itself, for all his
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 118 -->
followers had deserted him. They had, in fact, gone over to the
other side, with a canting recantation of their opinions, and a
whining declaration that they never should have thought of taking
arms against their lawful queen " had not Northumberland made
them do it." The unhappy duke himself was hanging about the
streets of Cambridge the next day, not knowing whether to give
himself up or " run for it," when the Earl of Arundel, coming up and
tapping him on the shoulder, observed, " You must come along with
me—you're my prisoner." Northumberland burst into a loud bellow,
fell upon his knees, and begged for his life; but Arundel,
contemptuously desiring an underling to " bring him along," lodged the
captive in the Tower. Poor Lady Jane, whose representations of the
part of queen had been limited to ten days, was already locked up,
and, in fact, the state prison was full to overflowing of her
unfortunate partisans. Her father, the Duke of Suffolk, obtained his
pardon on the 31st of July, through Mary, who, on the 3rd of August,
1553, made her triumphant entry into London, accompanied by her
little sister, afterwards the great Elizabeth. On the 18th of the same
month, Northumberland, his eldest son John, Earl of Warwick, and
two or three others, were brought to trial at Westminster Hall, when
they pleaded the general issue; but the chief prisoner, finding it
useless to throw himself upon the country, threw himself on the floor,
asking in the most abject terms, for mercy. This prostration was of
no avail, for sentence of death was speedily passed upon him; the
sycophant Suffolk (Lady Jane Grey's own father) being one of the
judges who presided at the trial. The Earl of Warwick behaved
with more spirit than his parent, and upon hearing that he was to die
as a traitor, which would involve the confiscation of his property,
he coolly requested that his unfortunate creditors might not be
victimised. " Don't pay me off, without paying them off, also," were
the chivalrous words of the young nobleman. The Marquis of
Northampton, when called upon for his defence, said that he had
been out with the hounds and engaged in field sports while the
conspiracy was going on, so that he had been quite upon another
scent; but this availed nothing for the sly old fox, who was
immediately found guilty. Sir John Gates, as well as Sir Henry
Gates, both of whom were fearfully unhinged, were also condemned;
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 119 -->
and Northumberland made a long penitential speech from the
scaffold, when, as if caught by the example, Sir John Gates opened out
with extraordinary eloquence. Poor Gates having been brought
to a close by a hint from the headsman, the axe and the curtain fell
together upon this fearful tragedy.


Mary soon began to show her papist predilections, and after
making Gardiner Chancellor, she proceeded to establish a most
rigorous censorship of the press, like a person who, having evil
designs, is anxious to get the watch-dog muzzled as speedily as
possible. She prohibited all persons from speaking against her, for a
time; but putting a prohibition on the press is like throwing coals
on a volcano, which gets smothered for a while, but is sure to burst
out with a stronger light on account of the attempt to extinguish it.


The fanaticism of Mary is said to have been caused by the
wretchedness of her early life, during which a brutal father was
continually threatening to chop off her head or make a nun of her.
That unnatural parent was one of those monsters to whom it seems
marvellous that children were ever given at all, for he could never
appreciate the blessings they were calculated to afford, and he was
for ever engaged in trying to mar their happiness. The stock from
which she came was, however, so abominably bad, that there is
nothing surprising in her cruelty; for when children happen to go
wrong, it may be taken as a general rule that they get from their
birth one half, and from their bringing-up the other half, of their
iniquity. Mary, who proved herself a worthy descendant of a most
unworthy sire, had turned the state prisons at once into warehouses
for storing up the fuel of future martyrdom. Cranmer, Latimer, and
others were stowed away with this view, while the queen herself
prepared for a coronation of unusual pageantry at Westminster.


The calm and philosophical Anne of Cleves—who will be
remembered as the queen that Henry refused to have at any price—was
a visitor to the show, and came to it in the same "fly" with the
Princess Elizabeth. The latter, as sister to the queen, carried the
crown in the procession, and was complaining of its weight in a
whisper—for she was always flirting with somebody—to Noailles, the
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 120 -->
French ambassador. " Be patient," replied the polite Parisian; " it
will be lighter when it is on your head; " and an interchange of winks
proved that the allusion was understood by the future sovereign of
England. A parliament was assembled in less than a week, and the
legislature that had lately been in favour of protestantism to the
fullest extent, now relapsed into all the forms of popery. Both
Houses opened with the celebration of mass, and Taylor, the Bishop
of Lincoln, who objected to such flagrant apostacy, was fairly kicked
down stairs, like a bill thrown out of the Upper House, where
tergiversation was the order of the day throughout the session.
Another bishop, of the name of Harley, the low comedian of the
episcopal bench, whom Burnet calls a " drie dogge," was also ejected
for exhibiting the same honourable consistency; but Harley
restored the good nature of the House by throwing a little humour
into his forced exit.


A convocation of the clergy was shortly afterwards held, to get
rid of the Reformation as far as it had gone, and bring Catholicism
back again. Some of the bishops conformed to the new regulations
laid down for them; but some few, who happened to be married,
found that, though shaking off an opinion was easy enough, getting
rid of a wife was far more difficult. The celibacy of the clergy was,
of course, insisted upon; but Holgate, Archbishop of York, however
happy he might have been never to have linked himself with Mrs.
Holgate at all, soon discovered that a divorce from that good lady
was not so easily accomplished as talked about. Several bishops who
had got entangled in the connubial noose, were nearly finding it a
halter for their necks, inasmuch as they were all deprived of their
sees, and some even of their lives, for having committed the offence
of matrimony. An attempt was made to save them, by urging that
the punishment accompanied the crime, and that it was hard to make
those suffer who must already have endured a great deal; but the
plea was not allowed to prevail, and deprivation was inflicted on all as
an equal punishment. Several of the bishops conformed, and it has
been said, in extenuation of their weakness, that their insincerity was
not in changing from protestant to catholic, but had consisted in their
originally veering round against their wills from catholic to
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 121 -->
protestant. It matters little whether, in turning from popery to the
Reformation, they had been robbing Peter to pay Paul, or whether,
in changing once more, they were guilty of some additional cheat,
in order to restore what they had taken from Peter; but it is not to
be denied, that on one occasion or the other they had been guilty of
gross apostacy.


On the 13th of November, 1553, Cranmer, Lady Jane Grey, her
husband Lord Guildford Dudley, and his brother Ambrose Dudley,
were all condemned to die as traitors, by judges many of whom were
the very people who had set on poor Jane to play the game, in which
she had never taken the smallest interest. After sentence had been
passed, execution was stayed. But Cranmer had no sooner been let
out upon the charge of treason, than it was found on searching the
office there was something else against him, whereupon he was taken
and locked up once more upon an accusation of heresy. Lady Jane
Grey had the freedom of the Tower presented to her in the shape of a
permission to walk about the gardens, while Guildford Dudley and
Ambrose were granted a few moderate indulgencies — amounting,
perhaps, to a set of skittles, a bat, trap, and ball, or a couple of
hockey-sticks. This moderation was, however, accompanied by other
acts of cruelty; and poor Judge Hales, who had really done nothing
but refuse to change his religion, was, though he had stoutly defended
the title of the queen, thrown into prison. The poor fellow went out
of his mind, and though he was liberated, he had got so fearfully
impressed with the idea of being burnt, that he thought to make
himself fire-proof by running into the water; but it was so deep, and
he stayed there so very long, that he unfortunately drowned himself.


Mary, who had been disappointed of several husbands — for
nobody who saw her would think of having her—now resolved to
make use of her position as Queen of England to draw some
unhappy victim into a marriage. Comparatively old, exceedingly hard,
and totally void of all the milk of human kindness, she was naturally
very inflammable, and she had already fallen in love with young Ned
Courtenay, a son of the Marquis of Exeter; but the predilection of
that young gentleman for her half-sister Elizabeth had somewhat
cooled the ardour of Mary, who found it was useless to set her cap at  
  
  
  VOL. II. r
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 122 -->
the young Earl of Devon, which was the title she had restored to
the courteous Courtenay.


The project of a marriage continued to fill the head of the queen,
but as it was evident there would be " nobody coming to marry her,"
and, indeed, " nobody coming to woo," unless she looked out pretty
sharply for herself, she threw aside all scruples of delicacy, and began
to advertise through the medium of her ambassadors. The Emperor
Charles of Spain had been affianced to her thirty years ago, and
though she might once have been accustomed to sing " Charlie's my
darling," in her youthful days, that prince had, long ago, grown old
enough to know better than to marry her. He nevertheless thought
she might be a good match for his son Philip, or rather that the latter
might be a match for the lady, inasmuch as the Spanish Prince was
crafty, cruel, and bigoted. Mary made a last effort to get a husband of
her own choice, by sending a proposal to Cardinal Pole, who would have
nothing to do with her. Thus, even her indelicate eagerness to rush
to the pole did not secure her election, and she was obliged to take
Philip " for better, for worse," or rather for worse, for want of a better.


When the Commons heard of her intention they respectfully
recommended her to wed an Englishman, but the idea that it was
necessary for Mary to "first catch the Englishman" does not seem
to have occurred to them. She announced her intention of marrying
Philip partly out of old associations, but the oldness of the
association was all on her own side, for the gentleman was young in
comparison to the lady. It was not to be expected that Philip would
make what he might justly have considered an " alarming sacrifice"
without some equivalent, and it was agreed that he should have the
honour and title of King of England, though he was not to interfere
in the government. In case Mary survived him, he was to settle
upon her,£60,000 a year, but as he always flattered himself that he
should, as he said, " see the old girl out," he looked upon this
arrangement as merely nominal.


The English people had in those days, as they still have in these,
an objection to Spanish marriages, and one Sir Thomas Wyatt, who
had been in Spain, gave such a fearful picture of Philip, that the
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 123 -->
people of Kent, learning to regard him as something between " Old
Bogie " and " Spring-heeled Jack," resolved to oppose his landing.
Wyatt collected a considerable force at Rochester and marched upon
London, when taking the first to the left, then the second to the right,
they found themselves masters of Southwark. He had intended to
give battle in Bermondsey, and put a cannon at the corner of the
street, but it did not go off so well as he expected. In the meantime
the queen's forces began pouring upon him some of the juice of the
grape, from the Tower, and intimating to his followers that it might
affect their heads, he withdrew as far as Kingston. His object was
to march upon London by the other road, and he had got about as
far as Hammersmith when an accident happened to his largest buss,
or blunderbuss—as he called his heaviest gun—and he wasted several
hours in getting it, once more, upon its wheels again. By daylight
he had got as far as Hyde Park, when he found that the royal forces
were in the enclosure of St. James's, waiting to receive him, and
having a large reserve in the hollow that now forms the reservoir.


The battle commenced with a noisy overture, consisting of the
firing of cannons, loaded only with powder, and doing no harm to
anybody. Wyatt's followers had dwindled very materially as he
came into town; several of his soldiers having discovered, at Kew,
it was not their " cue to fight," and others experiencing, at Turnham
Green, sufficient to turn 'em pale, and turn 'em back, at the very
thought of meeting the enemy. Wyatt was nevertheless undaunted,
and rushed upon the enemy, who, falling quietly back, let him
regularly in among the troops, with the full intention of never letting him
out again. Without looking behind, he charged, at full gallop, along
Charing Cross, and continuing his furious career up the Strand,
pulled up, at last, at Ludgate Hill, which he found closed against him.
Finding no sympathy among the citizens he attempted to back out,
and had got as far as the Temple, where, strange to say, his opponents
gave him no law, and the unhappy old Pump, being at last caught in
Pump Court, surrendered to Sir Maurice Berkeley. Poor Wyatt
was soon afterwards condemned to death, and executed, as well
as about four hundred of his followers, but several were brought
with ropes round their necks before the queen, who permitted them
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 124 -->
to find in the halter a loop-hole for escape, by an humble prayer
for pardon.

on a litter to London, though she was so ill that the journey might
have killed her, had not youth, a good constitution, and some stout
porters carried her through the dangerous ordeal. She was accused
of having been a party to Wyatfs rebellion, and was taken to
the Tower, though not without giving a good deal of trouble to the
proper officer, for she insisted on sitting down, every now and then,

Mar}*', whose reign may be considered as the original " reign of
terror,"—though the brutality that distinguished it was confined to a
few, while in the French edition the whole nation thirsted for blood
—who exercised en detail the cruelties that France subsequently
practised en gros, sentenced to death, in rapid rotation, all who did
not quite agree with her. The unfortunate Lady Jane Grey and her
husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were both executed on the same day,
and indeed the victims were so numerous that we should be inclined
to say, " for further particulars see small bills," if we thought that
any of the true bills found against the parties were still extant.


A curious commentary on the value of trial by jury was furnished
about this time, by the extraordinary case of Sir Nicholas
Throgmorton—the father of Throgmorton Street, and friend of Sir Thomas
Wvatt—who after making his defence, obtained, to the surprise of
everybody, a verdict of acquittal. Sir Thomas Bromley, the Chief
Justice, began to cough, and " hem and ha!" as if there must be
some mistake, and as though he would have said, " Gentlemen of the
jury, do you know what you are doing?" The twelve honest men
replied, that it was " all right," they "knew what they were about,"
and persisted in their decision, until the Chief Justice, who thought
every jury box ought to be a packing case, hinted that the matter
was one in which the Crown was interested, and that the Crown
would stand no nonsense. The jurymen being still firm, they were
hurried off to prison, and were only released upon paying enormous
fines; which proved, at least, that the Government set a tremendous
price upon their honesty.


On the 19th of July, 1.554, Philip landed at Southampton, on his
way to fulfil his marriage contract with Mary; but he had taken the
precaution to send on before him the Count of Egmont, who was
intended to be mistaken for his master, and thus serve as a sort of
pilot engine, in case of any collision with the populace. The
expedient was very necessary, for the pilot engine—we mean Egmont—
got some very hard knocks from several old buffers with whom he
came in contact, and Philip, seeing the kind of reception he might
expect, came accompanied by a very long train, by way of escort to
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 126 -->
his new station. On the 25th of the same month he was married to
the queen, at Winchester, and the pair, whom we must call, by
courtesy, " the happy couple," came to London, where a series of
festivities, including the rapid descent of II Diavolo Somebody, along
a rope from the top of St. Paul's,* had been prepared in honour of
the Royal marriage.  
  
  
  Philip and Mary.


The object of Philip in marrying Mary had been simply the crown,
and his conduct, if not his words, very plainly told her so. Her
fondness for him became quite a bore, particularly when he found
that she could not get Parliament to agree to the projects he made
her propose for his own aggrandisement. She had not long been the
wife of Philip, when an attack of dropsy was added to her other
interesting points, and her heartless husband made her a butt—or, as  
  
  
  A fact.—See Stowe.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P152_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 127 -->
Strype says, a water-butt—for his unfeeling ridicule. In order to
obtain a little popularity, Philip made his wife release Elizabeth, and
Courtenay, Earl of Devon, from the Tower, as well as a few other
favourites of the public, but the people never took to the husband of
the queen, while the quarrels between the Spanish and the English
were perpetual. On New-Year's Day, 1555, there was a row among
them at Westminster, when a Spanish friar got into the Abbey, and
pulled away at the alarum with tremendous fury. He frightened the
city almost into fits, and, for thus trifling with the rope, Philip
doomed him to the halter, in order to gratify the people, who by no
means chimed in with this extraordinary freak of bell-ringing.


The year 1555 was signalised by the revival of all the statutes
against heretics, and the Protestants were kept burning night and
day, in the neighbourhood of Smithfield. We will not dwell longer
than necessary upon this disgraceful portion of our national annals.
Among many distinguished persons who suffered death were Ridley,
Latimer, and Cranmer, who all exhibited firmness worthy of a better
fate; and it is said of Cranmer that he put his right hand into the fire
first, for having, some time before, signed some documents of
recantation, in the hope of saving his life at the expense of his consistency.
In three years about three hundred individuals perished at the stake,
through refusing to put their characters at stake by vacillation in the
moment of danger.


After the death of Cranmer, Cardinal Pole was installed in the see
of Canterbury, for Mary's rage against the Protestants was extreme,
and she hoped that the fires of Smithfield would be kept alive by that
exalted prelate, though in expecting to stir them up with the long
Pole she was somewhat disappointed, for the new archbishop was
rather moderate than otherwise in his ecclesiastical policy.


The queen's object was to control England in the war between
France and Spain, but Pole, even at the risk of becoming in his turn
a scaffold Pole, resisted the royal will to the extent of his power.
The fact is that Philip, who had never married for love, was
determined to be as plain with his wife as she was plain to him, and told
her that unless he could make his union profitable, he should make a
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 128 -->
slip-knot of the nuptial tie, and get away from it altogether. Alarmed
at the prospect of being left " a lone woman" on the throne, she
sought and found a pretext for declaring a war against France by
getting up one of those confessions which in those days a judicious
use of the torture could always procure at a few hours' notice.


Some unhappy agitators were detected in a small conspiracy,
when the fact or falsehood of their having been encouraged by Henry
of France was, after the intense application of the screw, regularly
screwed out of them. They were made to fabricate stories to suit
the purposes of the queen, and indeed their invention was literally
put to the rack by the cruelties to which they were subjected. War
against France was now declared, but the revenue was in such a
miserable state that Mary was obliged to beg, borrow, and steal in
every direction for the necessary funds to commence hostilities.
Having at last got together an army of ten thousand men, she found
that the troops must be fed, and she accordingly seized all the corn
she could find, threatening at the same time to thrash the owners like
their own wheat if they had the impudence to ask for the value of the
stolen property. The well-known impolicy of interfering in other
people's quarrels was powerfully illustrated by the fate of the English
interposition in the dispute between France and Spain, for after a
few trifling advantages, one of which was the taking of Ham before
breakfast by Philip himself, England sustained a loss, which was
at that time regarded as one of the most serious character. Valour,
under the guise of the great Duke of Guise, wrested Calais from its
masters, and restored it to the French, whose hearts rebounded with
boundless joy at the acquisition of this valuable fortress.


The exchequer was reduced to such a beggarly condition by the
expenses of the late unfortunate war, that the queen, who never
called upon her Parliament unless she wanted something, was
compelled to summon the Commons. With their usual squeezability they
permitted to flow into the public coffers sufficient to keep the royal
head above water; and one Copley, who ventured a few words by
way of remonstrance, was pusillanimously committed to that custody
from which the old English expression of " cowardy cowardy
custard" {query, custod.j has been supposed to derive its origin.
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 129 -->
Part of the produce of the recent subsidy was laid out in ships,
and as the ships came to no good, it was said at the time that this
appropriation of the money was very like making ducks and drakes
of it. The fleet after passing over the bosom of the ocean, came to
Brest, but the breastworks were so strong, that the British force had
not the heart to make an attack upon them. Some miscellaneous
pillage was perpetrated in the neighbourhood by the English, who
nevertheless came off second best; and Philip, who was getting rather
tired of the business, was willing to treat with a view to a treatv.


While thinking" how he should retire from foreign hostilities, he
received from England tidings that held out the certain prospect of
domestic peace, for he got the news of the death of his wife Mary.
Miserable and middle-aged, detested and dropsical, this wretched
woman was tormented by every kind of reflection, from that
presented by the mirror of her own mind, to the dismal prospect
shadowed forth in her looking-glass. She had lost Calais; but, as
the audacious Strype has boldly suggested, she might have become
callous to that, had she not known the fearful fact, that her
husband Philip declared he had had his fill of double cursedness, and
intended to try in Spain what a timely return to single blessedness
might do for him. All these troubles proved, like herself,
unbearable, and on the 17th of November, 1558, she expired, after a short
and yet too long a reign of five years, four months, and eleven days.
She had reached the forty-third year of her age, and must have made
the most of her time, in one way at least: for no woman of her age
had obtained so much odium of a durable quality, as she in her
comparatively short life had acquired.


If we were to draw a faithful character of this princess, we need do
nothing more than upset our inkstand over our paper, and cause the
saturated manuscript to be transferred to our pages in one
enormous black blot; for we are sure that no printer's type could furnish
a type of the person whom we have the horribly black job of
handingdown—or rather knocking down —to posterity. Those indefatigable
readers who are desirous of having the appropriate epithets which
Mary's character deserves, are requested to take down the dictionary,
and having selected from it all the adjectives expressive of badness  
  
  
  VOL. II. S
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 130 -->
that the language contains, place them in a string or a series of
strings, before the name of Mary.


To look for her virtues would require the aid of one of those solar
microscopes which give visibility to the merest atom, and the particle,
if even discovered, might be deposited in the mental eye without its

being susceptible of anything having entered it. She seems to have
possessed some sincerity; but this only gave a certain degree of vigour
to her evil propensities. She was perhaps susceptible of some
attachments, but so is a boa constrictor, though few would conceive it a
privilege to be held in the firm embraces of that paragon of tenacity
towards those with whose fate it happens to twine itself. She had a
certain vigour of mind, just as the tiger has a certain vigour of spring,
a parallel the force of which her victims very frequently experienced.  
  
  
  The loss of Calais was, perhaps, one of the most important events
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P156_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 131 -->
of Mary's reign, and it is said to have had such an effect upon her,
that she declared, when she died the word Calais would be found
engraved upon her heart: though we are quite sure, that if the word
had been found at all, it would not have presented itself as an
engraving, but as a lithograph. For two hundred years the town
had been in the possession of the English, and it was through a
miserable economy in cutting down the garrison during the winter
months, and trying to work the thing at a reduced expense, that the
whole concern fell into the power of the enemy. This paltry system
proved, of course, unprofitable in the end; for when the Duke of
Guise made his attack, those points that required two or three stout
fellows to defend them, were left to the fatal imbecility of " a man
and a boy,"—a couple never yet known to heartily co-operate. It is
the unhappy blunder of a man and a boy being left to pull together
as unsympathetically as an elephant and an ass, that has impeded
the progress of so many of our public works; and it was
unquestionably, the trial of the " man and boy " system at Calais during the
winter months, that, in the early part of 1558, caused the loss of the
city. The English had been in the habit of trusting during the
cold weather to the snow, and the overflowing of the marshes, to
keep out the French; but the Duke of Guise was not afraid of getting
his feet wet, and besides, as he wittily observed, " I can always rely
on the strength of my pumps to keep the water out." He ultimately
made a resolute splash, and, though often up to his middle in mud,
he drove the English clean out of the citadel.


It may be worth while to mention, that Mary's reign was the first
in which friendly relations with Russia were established, through
some English traders who found themselves, or rather lost
themselves, at Archangel, in the course of a wild-goose search for a
northeast passage. The Czar, after asking them what they were doing
there, and telling them they had come fearfully out of their way,
received them very kindly; but it does not seem that any north-east
passage, beyond the old court which used to lead from Holborn Hill
to Clerkenwell, was at that time discovered.


Few if any salutary laws were passed in her reign, though a bad
one was repealed, which had ruined the wool trade, by prohibiting
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 132 -->
anyone from making wool who had not served seven years'
apprenticeship. There was of course a great cry and very little wool in
consequence of this absurd enactment, which was so decidedly
impolitic that we can give Mary very little credit for having done
away with it.

but when the truth did come

which burst out on all sides

Good Queen Bess.


On the 15th of January, 1559, the queen was crowned at
Westminster Abbey, but during the ceremony she was compelled to
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P158_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 133 -->
remain bare-headed for a considerable time, as on account of her
suspected Protestant predilections not one of the Bishops would
invest her with the diadem. In vain did she give appealing looks
to the entire bench, until at last a decided ogle took effect on
Oglethorpe, the Bishop of Carlisle, who, snatching up the bauble with a
shout of " Here goes," boldly bonneted the royal maiden.


On the 25th of the same month a Parliament assembled, when
Cecil and Sir Nicholas Bacon made their debuts on the treasury
benches. Cecil was chief secretary, or key of the Cabinet, while
Bacon was great seal, with instructions to keep continually on the
watch in the capacity of Keeper. The first act of the Parliament was
to restore many of the laws of religion existing in Edward's reign,
and an attempt was made to reinstate such clergymen as had been
deprived on account of marriage; but Elizabeth, who begun to show
anti-matrimonial opinions at the very beginning of her reign, would
not accede to such an arrangement. Early in the session the
Parliament tried its hand at royal match-making by carrying up an address
to the queen, recommending her to take a husband; but in a
somewhat prudish tone she expressed at once her horror at " the fellows,"
and her determination to have nothing to do with them. Her
sincerity was soon put to the test by a direct offer from Philip, her late
sister's husband; but a playful " go along with you," and a coquettish
\"a-done, do!" were the utmost words of encouragement he could
manage to extract from her.


Parliament broke up on the 8th of May, and on the 15th the bishops
and other churchmen of note were summoned to take the oath of
conformity to the new statutes. Much to the credit of their
consistency they all refused, with the exception of one Kitchen, the Bishop
of Llandaff, a low fellow, whose name implies his origin. This Kitchen
had acquired the rotatory motion of the roasting-jack, as well as a
fondness for sops in the pan, for he had been twirling round and
having a finger in the ecclesiastical pie since the year 1545, from
which time to that of Elizabeth he had, through all changes, stuck to
his bishopric. The clergy who had refused to conform to the Protestant
religion, were on the whole gently dealt with, some being exported
to Spain amid the luggage of the Spanish ambassador, and a few being
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 134 -->
quartered upon their successors in England. Most of the inferior clergy
seemed to have been made of Kitchen-stuff, that is to say, they
appeared to be composed of much the same material as the Bishop
Kitchen we have named, and were at all events alive to the necessity of
keeping the pot boiling, for out of 9400 persons holding benefices, there
were scarcely more than a hundred, exclusive of the fifteen bishops, who
quitted their preferments rather than change their religion.


We must now look at Scotland, of which the celebrated Mary was
queen when she was suddenly called to France to share the throne
which had devolved upon her husband, Francis II., or rather, upon
which he had devolved by the death of his father, Henry. This
somewhat elderly gentleman had been playing the fool in a tilting
match, which was rather infra dig. at his time of life, and ended in
his receiving a dig in the eye from a broken lance, which ultimately
closed in death both the wounded and its companion optic. In the
absence of Mary from Scotland, Elizabeth did her utmost to advance
the Protestant cause in that country, and dealt out some heavy blows
through the medium of the celebrated Knox against the Catholics.
Mary's mamma, who had remained at home to keep house, as it were,
in her daughter's absence, did not exactly like what was passing,
particularly when she found that English emissaries were continually
passing to and fro, for the purpose of bribing the Scotch, whose
"itching palm" has always been a national characteristic that we
decline accounting for. The English were bent on getting the French
out of Scotland, but the task was as difficult as expelling the fleas
from a hay mattress, in which they have once got embedded.


After a good deal of desultory fighting, the Queen Regent was
worried out of her life, and she was no sooner gone, than some of
her most devoted adherents were off like shots to draw up a treaty
with the enemy. Peace was proclaimed, and the French Governor
of Leith gave the besiegers a dinner, at which salted horse was the
only animal food, for there was not even a saddle of mutton to make
the horse go off with effect at this truly horsepitable banquet. By
the treaty mutual indemnities were exchanged, oblivion of the past
was determined upon at Leith, which on that occasion became a
veritable Lethe. Elizabeth had two or three flags in Scotland
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 135 -->
surrendered to her, but religion, which was the ostensible cause of
the whole dispute, was permitted to stand over as an open question.
It was not to be expected that such a capital match as the Queen of
England would fail to be the subject of several flames, and an old
beau, in the person of Eric, now the King of Sweden, together with
two or three other suitors, royal as well as noble, sent in the most
tender tenders for the hand of Elizabeth. Like a true coquette, she
gave encouragement to all; and even some seedy adventurers among
her own subjects were induced to strike up to her.


Mary, who as great niece of Henry VIII. had in the first instance
assumed the arms and title of Queen of England, a measure almost
as futile as if Snooks of Surrey should assume the arms and title of
Seringapatam, relinquished her nominal pretensions upon the death
of her husband, which happened on the 5th of December, 1560.
Mary had become so habituated to the splendid formalities of the
French Court, that on returning to Scotland the substantial
barrenness of that bleak country completely disgusted her. Tears, it is
said, came into her eyes when she saw the wretched ponies that
were about to convey herself and her ladies from the water-side to
Holyrood, while the saddles, made of wood, gave her such a series
of bumpers at parting that she declared the impression made by her
reception would never be forgotten.


Mary, who had been born and bred a Catholic, was of course
anxious for the privilege of following her own religion; but her
Scotch subjects, who claimed liberty of conscience for themselves,
practised upon their unfortunate sovereign the most brutal and
intolerant tyranny. She was insulted on her way to mass, her
indulgence in the most harmless amusements was savagely condemned,
and she was continually exposed to the hardest raps from Knox, who
undertook the task of converting her. This vulgar, but zealous, and
no doubt sincere personage endeavoured to effect his purpose by
coarse abuse, and always spoke of his queen from the pulpit as
Jezebel. In vain did Mary endeavour to quiet her turbulent and
libellous assailant by offering him private audiences; but, as if
nothing short of mob popularity would answer his purpose, he rudely
declined her invitation, telling her it was her duty to come to him,
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 136 -->
and continued to make the pulpit the medium of the most malignant
assaults on his sovereign. However honest and upright the
intentions of Knox may have been, his brutal manner of telling his home
truths deprived them of much of their influence; and Knox made
very few effective hits in the course of his noisy and vituperative
career as a Presbyterian Reformer.


Elizabeth saw with unamiable pleasure that her rival, Mary, was
having what, very figuratively speaking, may be termed, a nice time
of it. The English queen busily occupied herself in feathering her
own nest in a variety of ways, and, among other measures, she called
in all the debased coin; for, as she sometimes said, with a sneer at
poor Mary, " I have a great objection to light sovereigns." She
filled her arsenals with arms, and had quite a conservatory of grape
at the Tower, while, by way of putting the country into a state of
defence, she resorted to the very odd expedient of reviewing the
militia. She improved the arts of making gunpowder and casting
cannon, so that, as she used to say, " every brave brick in my army
may have a supply of mortar, with which, in the hour of battle, he
may cement the interests of my empire."


The increase of the navy occupied her special care, and she laid
the foundation of that glorious system which has given immortality
to our naval hornpipes, and made our enemies dance at the balls
given by our British seamen. It was to Elizabeth we owe the origin
of that enthusiasm which induces " honest Jack," as he facetiously
calls himself, to spend all his wages in a week, and to conclude a
rapid series of light-hearted freaks as the helplessly inebriated fare
of a metropolitan cab, or the equally inanimate inmate of a London
station-house. The interior of Elizabeth's Court was a scene of petty
rivalries and jealousies, for she was surrounded with various suitors,
and though she gave encouragement to nearly all, the valuable
precept, " Ne sufor ultra crepidam," seems never to have escaped her
memory. She would treat them with easy familiarity, such as
thumping their backs and patting their cheeks; but if any of them
ventured upon trying to get on with her at the same slapping pace,
she would administer a rap of the knuckles that at once discouraged
them from trying"their hands at a renewal of such familiarity.
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 137 -->

Though not blinded to the adulation of her courtiers, she was
very nearly becoming so by the small-pox, against which, however,
a good constitution was happily pitted. On her recovery, the
Parliament, fearing the explosion that might have ensued had she popped
off without a successor having been named, entreated her either to

  marry, or appoint some lady or gentleman to fill the throne in the

event of there being a vacancy. With a good deal of that old
traditional feeling imputed to the anonymous dog in the very indefinite
manger, who was unwilling to relinquish to others what he was
unable personally to enjoy, Elizabeth was very reluctant to say who
should come after her as queen, but she held out a vague prospect
that her marriage would not be impossible, in the event of any very
eligible offer happening to present itself. This indirect
advertisement of her hand was at once answered by the Duke of Wirtemberg,
a small German, whose pretensions were contemptuously
poohpooh'd ! and indeed every post brought letters from various single  
  
  
  VOL, II. T
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P163_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 138 -->
men of prepossessing appearance, gentlemanly manners, and amiable
disposition, who were anxious to take this somewhat unusual
method of placing their hands and hearts at the service of the
Queen of England. In the very largest field there will generally be
one or two favourites, and in Elizabeth's gocd books the names ot
Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex,
stood so high, that there might have been even betting upon both,
with a shade or two, perhaps, in the former's favour.


Mary of Scotland was less indifferent on the subject of marriage
than the English queen, and, indeed, the former went so seriously
into the matrimonial market, as to consult the latter on the subject
of a judicious selection. Apparently with the intention of throwing
the matter back, Elizabeth offered her own favourite, Dudley, Earl
of Leicester, as a husband for Mary; but on the latter, after
recovering from her surprise, exclaiming, "Well, I don't mind," the virgin
Queen of England, mentally responding, " Oh ! yes! I dare say,"
backed out of her proposition. The Earl of Leicester was one ot
those good-looking scamps who used, in the last century, to go by
the name of " pretty fellows," but in our own more enlightened age,
would obtain no gentler appellation than " pretty scoundrels." The
virtuous Elizabeth liked to have him about her on account of his
good looks, but if the homely proverb, that " handsome is as
handsome does," had prevailed, he would have been thought as little
ornamental in person, as in mind he was deformed and hideous.
Notwithstanding the pattern of propriety as which the virgin Queen
of England has been, by some historians, extolled, she gave
encouragement to Leicester, whom she knew to be a married man,
until, by murdering his wife, he removed that slight barrier to the
accomplishment of his ambitious wishes. He reported that his
unfortunate lady had tumbled down stairs, but this was a daring flight
of a guilty imagination, and there is little doubt that while staying
in the house of her husband's servant, Foster, he forced her either
over the balustrade, or got rid of her by some other means of
equal violence.


Poor Mary, who was really in need of a protector, becoming
impatient at the delay in choosing her a husband, at length selected
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 139 -->
one for herself, in the person of her cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord
Darnley. This young nobleman was a mere lad in age, but a
perfect ladder in height, for he was very tall, and very thin, so that if  
  
  
  Lord Oarnley

he could offer Mary no substantial support, he was, at all events, a
person she might look up to, as may be said, familiarly, " at a stretch,"
in cases of great emergency. He was the son of Henry VIII.'s
sister's daughter's second husband, and was accordingly the next
heir but one to the English throne, if any one could be called an
heir at all in those days, when might overcame right in a manner
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P165_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 140 -->
somewhat unceremonious. Darnley, though showy in appearance,
was in reality a fool, and it might be said, that instead of having been
born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he was in himself the
embodiment of that auspicious article. Though exceedingly tall, he was
tremendously shallow, and before he had been married two months,
he acted with so much insolence, that Mary could scarcely get a
servant to stay with her. His own father, old Lennox, who had got a
snug place in the household, packed up his box at a moment's notice,
declaring he would not stop, and the wretched royal spoon found in
the glass the only pursuit with which his habits were congenial.


Though neglectful of his young and lovely wife, he claimed the
bad husband's privilege of being jealous of the attentions of others,
and Signor DavidRizzio, the first and only tenor at the Scotch
court, soon furnished ground for Darnley's suspicions of Mary's
fidelity. Rizzio had come over in the suite of the ambassador of
Savoy, as a professor of the spinet, and a teacher of foreign
languages. In his vocal capacity he attended evening parties, and
having been introduced at court, his airs soon wafted him into the
favour of his sovereign. His knowledge of the French language
caused him to be promoted to the vacant post of French secretary to
the queen, when an outcry was raised because a Scotchman was not
appointed to the office, though.not a soul among the natives had any
pretensions to understanding the language in which the services of a
secretary were required. Many of them maintained that their broken
Scotch would have been an excellent substitute for Rizzio's
unintelligible gibberish, and the nobles used to make faces at him,
shoulder him, or taunt him as a base-born fiddler even in the
presence of his sovereign.


The ill-used musician, who understood scarcely a word of the
insulting language that was addressed to him, happening to catch
the sound of the word fiddle, gallantly declared that he would be
found toufours fidclc to the royal lady who had honoured him by her
favour. There seems to be good reason for doubt whether the
scandalous stories concerning Mary and her French secretary were
true, and as in duty bound we give the benefit of the doubt to the
accused parties. Poor Rizzio had however become such an object of
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 141 -->
hatred to the people about the Court, that one evening, as he sat at
a side-table taking his supper, as he always did when the queen was
present, a party of armed men, headed by Darnley himself, rushed
into the chamber, where the Duchess of Argyle, and Erskine, the
Governor of Holyrood, were also present. Rizzio had probably been
favouring the company with a song or songs, and was whetting his
whistle, with a view perhaps to further melody, when he was brutally
desired to "come out of that" by the ruffian Ruthven, whose gout
for murder was so excessive that he had left a sick bed to take a
part in the sanguinary business. To make a long and painful story
short, Rizzio was savagely butchered as he clung to the skirts
of Mary's dress, in a vain hope to find shelter under petticoat
influence. For having caused the death of Rizzio, Mary never
forgave Darnley, who took to drink, in the hope of drowning care;
but an evil conscience seems to be supplied with corks, which carry
it up to the surface of the deepest bowl in which an attempt was ever
made to get rid of it.


On the 19th of June, 1566, there appeared among the births of the
day, the announcement of " Mary, Queen of Scots, of a son and heir
at Holyrood." The infant was James VI., of Scotland, and
subsequently the first of England, who was not a Jem remarkable for any
particular brilliancy. It had previously been arranged that Elizabeth
should stand godmother to the first-born of Mary, and intelligence
of the interesting event was therefore conveyed to the English Queen
by special express through that diligent overland male, the faithful
Melville. Elizabeth was having a romp after a supper at Greenwich
when the news arrived, and was in the midst of a furious fandango,
when Cecil whispered something in her ear which struck her all of a
heap, and caused her to leave her fandango unfinished. Speedily,
however, regaining her composure, she gave the ambassador
something for himself, and charged him with the usual infantine presents
for her royal godson.


The question of a successor to Elizabeth now turned up again
with increased interest since the birth of little James; but Elizabeth,
becoming irritable and ill-humoured, declared she was looking out
for a husband, and intended to have an heir of her own, which would
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 142 -->
put an end to all the airs and graces which other people were
exhibiting. When the Commons greAV more urgent on the point, she
became angry in the extreme, for the subject must have been rather
a delicate one with Elizabeth, who was growing every day a less
eligible match, and might not perhaps have succeeded in finding a
husband equal in point of station to an alliance with the Queen
of England.

exercised. In ordering a dinner or forming a cabinet his wishes
were equally disregarded, and if he happened to have objected to a
particular dish he was very likely to be told there was nothing else

<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 143 -->
in the house; while Murray, Bothwell, and Huntley, whom he hated,
were appointed to the ministry. It was at length determined to
get him entirely out of the way; and, as he happened to have
taken the small-pox, it was agreed that he should sleep out, on
account of the baby, who, though very soon cowed in his after life,
had not undergone the process of vaccination, for the simple reason
that Dr. Jenner had not invented it. Darnley had consequently
a bed at a lonely house called the Kirk-a-field, where he was
taken in only that he might be the more effectually done for
by his enemies.


An explosion was heard in the middle of the night, and on the
next morning the house was found in ruins, with Darnley doubled
up under a tree at some considerable distance. It was reported that
lightning had been the cause of the event; but it is not likely that
lightning would have known how to conduct itself with such
precision as to have carried Darnley out of a three-pair-of-stairs window,
and lay him down at a considerable distance from the house, without
breaking a bone, or inflicting a bruise of any description whatever.
There is every ground for suspicion that Bothwell and his colleagues
were instrumental to Darnley's death; but in order to throw dust
—or gold-dust—in the public eye, they offered a reward of two
thousand pounds for the murderers. This liberality was cheap
enough, for they knew they could not be called upon to pay any
reward, they being themselves the parties for whom they
advertised. A paper war was nevertheless commenced upon the walls,
in which the murderers were advertised for on one side, and pointed
out by name upon the other, when fresh rewards were offered, and
the bill-stickers warned to beware of the libel they were helping
to disseminate.


At length, such a stir was created, that on April 12th, 1567,
Bothwell was put upon his trial, when by some wilful negligence the
counsel for the prosecution had no brief, and was of course unable
to offer any evidence. The accused was accordingly acquitted, and
the ends of justice were defeated in a manner that sometimes prevails
in our own day, by an omission to instruct counsel; which seems to
be a failing that may at least claim the merit of antiquity.
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 144 -->

Though Bothwell was not to be executed for his crime, he
was destined to be married; which, next to the capital penalty, was
perhaps the highest he could pay, particularly as Mary, who had
already seen out a couple of husbands and a favourite, was the lady
destined for his future partner. Bothwell had the audacity to give
a supper at a tavern in Edinburgh, at the close of the session of
Parliament—an entertainment somewhat similar to our ministerial
whitebait arrangement at Blackwall—when he drew from his
pocket a recommendation of himself as a fitting husband for the
Queen of Scotland.


Eight bishops, nine earls, and seven lords, most of whom were
under the influence of toddy, which turned them into toadies of
Bothwell, affixed their names to the document; and, armed with this
instrument, he, at the head of a thousand horse, effected the forcible
abduction of Mary on her way from Stirling Castle. An elopement on such
an extensive scale was something very unusual, even in those days
of extravagance, and it has been doubted whether it was with Mary's
own consent that Bothwell ran away with her. It is, however,
indisputable that, after making him Duke of Orkney on the 12th
of May, she married him on the 15th, and a number of fresh raps
from Knox followed, as a matter of course, the imprudence she
had been guilty of. Her subjects took so much offence at this
proceeding, that they rose against her; and Bothwell, abandoning
her to her fate by flying to Denmark, left her to settle the matter
as she could with her own people. A defenceless woman, and a
female in distress, was of course impotent against an army of raw
Scotchmen—whose rawness is so excessive that they can very
seldom be done—and Mary was consigned as a prisoner to the
island of Lochleven.


It may be as well to dispose of Bothwell at once, before we
proceed; and, having traced him to Denmark, we meet him picking
up a scanty subsistence by doing what we are justified in terming
pirates' work in general. The badness of business or some other
cause ultimately turned his head, and we find him subsequently
an inmate of an asylum for lunatics. Here he took to writing
confessions; but some of them were so vague, and all of them so
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 145 -->
contradictory, that recollecting the horrid story-teller Bothwell was
known to be, we are at a loss to decide how much credit may be
attached to his statements.


If, as a general rule, we may believe half what is said, we shall
believe nothing that Bothwell has told us : for he has himself
contradicted one half of his own story, and the other moiety must be struck
off in pursuance of the principle we have just been adverting to. The
fact of his death, not having come from his own mouth, may,
however, be safely relied upon.


While Mary was a prisoner at Lochleven, her subjects took
advantage of her helplessness to make her sign her own abdication,
and settle the crown on the head of her baby son, whose first caps
had scarcely been laid aside when they had to be replaced by the
royal diadem. Her half-brother, Murray, was appointed regent, and,
coming over to Scotland, he was crowned at Stirling, where all who
declared themselves sterling friends of poor Mary, gave in their
adherence to the new ruler.


There was staying with the governor of the prison a young
hobbledehoy of the name of George Douglas, who being on a visit to
his brother, was allowed the privilege of seeing the royal captive.
Master George Douglas, in natural accordance with the
sentimentality peculiar to seventeen, fell sheepishly in love with the handsome
Mary. She gave some encouragement to the gawky youth, but
rather with the view of getting him to aid her in an escape, than out
of any regard to the over sensitive stripling. Going to his brother's
bedroom in the night, the boy took the keys from the basket in which
they were deposited, and letting Mary out, he handed her to a skiff
and took her for a row, without thinking of the row his conduct was
leading to.


When she reached the shore she was joined by several friends,
and marched, as the only lady among six thousand men, in the
direction of Dumbarton. Murray, however, was instantly on the
alert, and meeting her near Glasgow, he gave her such a routing,
that she was glad to fly anywhere she could, to get out of the
way of his rough treatment. After some little consideration she  
  
  
  VOL. 11. u
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 146 -->
determined to make for England; and, throwing herself and
retinue into a fishing-smack, she sailed smack for Workington,
whence she resolved on walking to Carlisle, against the advice
of her followers.  
  
  
  Though Elizabeth had expressed some sympathy towards Mary  
  
  
  Queen Mary's Elopement

in her struggles, the English queen determined that her Scottish
sister was not a person that could be received at the Court of a
virgin—and such a virgin-—sovereign. The unfortunate woman,
who had come over for protection as a fugitive, was at once
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P172_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 147 -->
made a prisoner, first at Carlisle and then at Bolton, when she
was virtually put upon her trial for the purpose of ascertaining
whether she was good enough to be visited by that dragon of virtue,
the chaste Elizabeth.


In order to inculpate the Queen of Scots, an old
melodramatic incident, that then perhaps had the merit of novelty, was
resorted to by Murray, who produced, towards the closing scene
of the trial, a packet of letters, by which it was pretended that
Mary had furnished proofs of her own share in the murder of her
husband Darnley.


It was not very likely that, if guilty, she would have taken the
trouble to commit the fact to paper, or to leave the letters about; and
it only wanted a dagger wrapped in rag smeared over with red ochre,
to complete the melodramatic denouement that Murray seemed
anxious to arrive at. These " properties," if we may be allowed
the expression, had an unfavourable effect upon Mary's cause, and
a delay having taken place in the proceedings, Murray took
advantage of it to offer to wash out the red ochre from the retributive
rag, and throw all the letters in the fire, on condition of his being
left to do as he pleased with the Scotch regency. To this
proposition Mary refused to accede, and defied him to the proof of
his charges, which were believed to be chiefly false; and she
retaliated upon him by accusing him of having been accessary to the
death of Darnley.


As Elizabeth candidly acknowledged that she believed neither,
she at first thought of punishing both; but at length Murray was
furnished with means to return home, while poor Mary was
conveyed to Tutbury in the county of Stafford, where it does not appear
that even the old woman of Tutbury was allowed to be sometimes
the companion of her captivity.


The royal prisoner was now under the supervision of the Earl of
Shrewsbury, and was permitted, at last, to see a few visitors, several
of whom were smitten by the charms of one who, though become a
little passee, was, from the gentleness of her manners, always sure to
be popular. Norfolk was so much taken with her that he offered
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 148 -->
her his hand, and promised to employ it in handing her on to the
throne of England.


As there was still an obstacle to the marriage, outstanding in the
name of Bothwell, Mary could only consent subject to that person's
approval. The piratical business in Denmark having become slack,
he was glad to take a small bonus to agree to a divorce, and an
alliance between Norfolk and Mary, Queen of Scots, was understood,
in private circles, to be one of the marriages in high life which the
season would see solemnised.


Unfortunately for the parties interested, Mary had to send a
remittance, in the year 1571, to some friends in Scotland, and the
post being either irregular or untrustworthy, she had despatched the
communication by hand, through a confidential servant of the Duke
of Norfolk, whose name was Banister. This Banister, who was not
in the secret, went gaping about with the letter in his hand, and,
thinking there was something mysterious about it, took it to Lord
Burleigh, whose significant shakes of the head have earned him
a note of admiration (!) in the pages of history.


Burleigh, taking the letter in his hand, and placing his
forefinger on the side of his nose, began to wag his head from side
to side, like the pendulum of a clock, as if he would be up to the
time of day, according to his usual fashion; when, deliberately
holding the letter up to the light, he, in the most ungentlemanly
manner, perused every word of it. He ascertained that Norfolk
and Mary were contriving to drive Elizabeth from the throne, and
the Duke was accordingly brought to trial. The stupidity of his
servants completed his ruin, for his secretary, instead of
destroying the evidences of his master's guilt, had merely stowed them
away under the door-mats, and stuffed them among the tiles, so
that the house from top to toe bore testimony to the guilt of
its owner.


He was beheaded in 1572, Elizabeth declaring, as she always did
when it was too late, that she intended pardoning him, but that
somehow or other her royal clemency was not forthcoming until it
was too late to be of any use to its contemplated object.
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 149 -->

The queen was urged by many of her admirers to get rid of Mary
at once; but, as a cat delights to play with a mouse, Elizabeth
seemed to take pleasure in exercising a feline influence over her
unfortunate prisoner. The Protestant cause had, about this time, been
violently assailed in France, and Elizabeth encouraged the departure
of English volunteers to aid the French Huguenots.


Among the British auxiliary legion that went forth on this
expedition were, of course, a number of adventurers, but one of

them, in particular, was destined to cut a conspicuous figure in
the history of his country. This was Walter Raleigh, who had
been in the habit of huzzaing at every royal progress, and keeping
up a loyal shouting at the side of the carriage of the queen,
whenever he met it in the public thoroughfares. In her visits to
Greenwich, Raleigh was often found waiting at the stairs to see her land,
and on one occasion the queen was about to set her foot in a puddle,
when the adventurer, taking off his cloak, converted it into a
temporary square of carpeting, to prevent Elizabeth from making a
greater splash than she intended, on her arrival at Greenwich. The
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P175_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 150 -->
cloak itself was of no particular value, and a little water was more
likely to freshen it up than to detract from its already faded beauty;
but the incident flattered the vanity of the queen, and it is said
that she never forgot the delicate attention that Walter Raleigh
had shown to her.


In the year 1571a rumour got into circulation that a match was
on the tapis between Mary and the Duke of Anjou, one of the brothers
of the French king; and though the report was unfounded, Elizabeth
was so jealous of any one marrying anybody but herself, that she, for
about the twentieth time, threw herself into the European market, as
an eligible investment for anyone who would venture upon a
speculation of such a very awful character.


She sent over Walsingham as her ambassador, to see what could
be done; but the Duke of Anjou, after sufficient negotiation to put
an end to any match that might have been contemplated between
Mary and himself, had the firmness to decline the honour of an
alliance with Elizabeth. The aged angler next baited a hook for the
young Duke of Alencon, the boy brother of the Duke of Anjou, but
the friends of the child stepped in to prevent the sacrifice.


It was not long after the events we have described, that a
conspiracy to take Mary out of prison, and put Elizabeth out of the
world, was by accident discovered. One Babington, a man of
ardent mind, was implicated in this disgraceful affair, which was
discovered by the dangerous and irregular practice of thrusting letters
through chinks in walls,—at a time, however, when the post-office
arrangements were not so complete as to afford the comfort and
convenience of a regular letter-box.


Mary was undeniably implicated in the plot, which was so
clumsily carried on that fourteen of the parties concerned were
executed before she even knew that the scheme had been detected.
She was taking an airing on a palfrey,—one of those whose wretched
trappings had made her think "caparisons are indeed odious," as
she thought of her riding excursions in her dear France,—when a
messenger from the queen turned her horse's head towards
Fotheringay Castle, in Northamptonshire. Commissioners were instantly
<!-- Leaf 177 -->
  
  
,
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P177_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 151 -->
sent down to try her for conspiracy, and on the 25th of October,
1586, sentence was pronounced against her in the Star Chamber.


When Elizabeth heard the decision, she affected the utmost
reluctance to sign the warrant for Mary's execution; and indeed this
reluctance seems to have been somewhat sincere, for she wished the
death of her rival without any of the odium attaching to a share in
an act of so much cruelty. The English queen would have preferred
that one of her subjects should have anticipated the effect of a
deathwarrant, by taking the life of Mary a little in advance; but no
one was base or brutal enough to further the obvious wishes of the
female tyrant.


The signing of the warrant was performed amid sighs and tears,
before Sir Robert Cary, Dame Cary, and the little Carys, when some
of the children thought they recognised tears of sincerity falling
from Elizabeth's eyes; but Mother Cary's chickens we must not
depend upon. After some months of delay and duplicity, during
which poor Mary was kept in a state of suspense more cruel than
death itself, the warrant was signed; but Elizabeth endeavoured,
as far as possible, to throw the blame on her ministers. This
only aggravates her conduct, for her being ashamed of it shows
she was aware of its enormity, and that she did not consider
herself to be merely performing an act of straightforward duty,
though a painful one, in consigning to an ignominious death her
sister sovereign.


Mary was executed on the 7th of February, 1587, in the
fortyfifth year of her age; and it is said that when the executioner held
up her head by its auburn locks, they came off in his hand, and the
grey stubble underneath proved too plainly that Mary had lived for
many years a secret adherent to wig principles.

  FEW weeks had elapsed
after the execution of poor
Mary, when an ambassador,
to palaver over the
unfortunate queen's only son, James,
was sent to Scotland by
Elizabeth. When the lad first heard
the news he began to roar like

rights of it." " Nobody has any right to murder my mamma," was
the reply of the boy, who again opened the sluices of his grief, and
allowed the tears to irrigate his face with a couple of meandering
rivulets. At length silence being obtained, the ambassador declared
that the amputation of Mary's head was accidental as far as Elizabeth
was concerned; but, " axe-i-dental you mean," was the bitter reply
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P180_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 153 -->
of her sobbing offspring. The messenger, nevertheless, persisted
that the Queen of England meant nothing by signing the
deathwarrant; that, in fact, she had been "only in fun;" and as he wound
up with the offer of an increased pension to James, the heartless brat
dried his eyes, with the observation, that " What's done can't be
undone," and pocketed a quarter in advance of his enlarged income..
That Elizabeth had really been determined upon Mary's death, is a
point upon which our sagacious readers will require no
enlightenment; for to them the character of the royal catamountain—we use
the Johnsonian word, in preference to the old, familiar term of
catamaran—will be clear, from the gallons of midnight oil which we have
bestowed upon it. How to get rid of Mary was, in fact, a subject of
frequent deliberation between the English queen and her creatures—
pretty creatures they were—among whom Leicester and Walsingham
stood prominent. Leicester had proposed poison, while Elizabeth
suggested assassination; but the dagger and bowl, the emblems of
legitimate tragedy, were both laid aside for the farce of a trial.


When the sanguinary business was done, the chief actors in it
threw the blame upon the subordinates, and poor Mr. Secretary
Davison was declared by Elizabeth to have been the sole cause of the
execution of the Scottish queen, because he had assisted in executing
the deed that consigned her to the scaffold. When Davison was
accused of the act, he went about, exclaiming, " I! Well, that is the
coolest!—'Pon my word! What next r" But he soon found what was
next, for he was committed to prison, and fined ten thousand pounds,
merely to give colour to the accusation. When confidentially apprised
of the cause of his detention, he went into hysterics at the
half-ridiculous, half-melancholy, idea of his being impounded to give colour
to a charge which was altogether false; and " It only just cleans me
out 1—ruins me, by Jove ! " was the touching remark he made as he
paid the entire fine imposed upon him, and quitted the prison.


Philip of Spain was now becoming desirous of an attack upon
England, without having any definite views, beyond a desire for
mischief, which was inherent in his character. He had got together
a very formidable fleet, and Elizabeth taking alarm, tried all sorts of
plans to check his warlike purpose. One of the expedients of her  
  
  
  VOL. II. x
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 154 -->
ministers—and it was not a bad one—was to throw discredit on a
quantity of Philip's bills, in the hope of his finding a difficulty in
getting them discounted. Sir Francis Drake was despatched to
Cadiz with a fleet of thirty sail, and Elizabeth having on his departure
said to him, affectionately, " Go, and do your best, Drake—there's a
duck," he dashed into Cadiz Bay, knocked down four castles, sunk a
hundred ships—forecastles included—and going home by the Tagus,
took a large man-of-war from under the very nose of the Marquis
of Santa Cruz, and then made him a polite obeisance from the
bow of the vessel. Philip did not relax in his preparations for
invading England, and he got together a very numerous fleet, by
hiring vessels wherever he could, and sending his emissaries to
engage a whole squadron at a time, like an individual who, jumping
into the first cab on a stand, desires the whole rank to follow him.
The Armada—for such it was called—became, of course, rather
numerous than select; but there is no doubt that if its quality was
queer, its quantity was most respectable.


The naval service of England had been so shabbily provided for,
that the British fleet did not exceed thirty-six sail of the line; though
by-the-bye, as the authorities have just told us that Drake took or
demolished one hundred ships at Cadiz, there seems a slight error in
figures, which will occasionally happen in the best regulated histories.


As it was not known where the enemy was to land, the High
Admiral, Lord Howard of Effingham, was obliged to exclaim—" Now,
gentlemen, spread yourselves, spread yourselves !" as he ordered
Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, to the command of their respective
detachments. The gallant Drake took up his station at Ushant, as
if he would have said " You shan't," to any foe who might have come
to that point to effect a landing. Hawkins cruised near the Scilly
Islands to look out, as he said, for the silly fellows who should come
in his way; and Lord Henry Seymour cruised along the Flanders
coast, while other captains vigorously scoured the Chops of the
Channel. It was expected that the Spanish Armada would have
come down the Thames, and perhaps amused themselves with an
excursion to Rosherville, which was strongly fortified, as well as all
the places on the river. The Roshervillians threw themselves into
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 155 -->
the arms of their resident baron; and the peaceful inhabitants of
Sheerness prepared to fight, out of sheer necessity. Catholics and
Protestants vied with each other in eagerness to repel the invader
from their shores; and the gallant fellows living near the Tower,
declared in their blunt but expressive language, that " though the foe
might pass a Gravesend, outlive a Blackwall, or go in safety through
a Greenwich, he would most assuredly never survive a Wapping ! "


The queen herself, having driven down in her tilbury to Tilbury
Fort, mounted a saddle-horse, and, flushed by her nautical enthusiasm,
she looked a very horse-marine as she cantered about upon her steed
in the presence of her people. The Earls of Essex and Leicester
having held her rein, she majestically bridled up, and sent forth
among the crowd a volley of clap-traps, declaring she had come
among them, as the song says—  
  
  
  " To conquer, to conqu-e-e-er,
To co-o-onquer, or to boldly dic-i-i-i-e."


At length it was determined by Philip that the Spanish Armada
should set out; and, as Strype pleasantly tells us, " a pretty set-out
they made of it." Poor Santa Cruz, the high admiral, made a most
unlucky hit to begin with, by falling ill and dying, when his second
in command, the Duke of Parma, followed his leader's example, with
most inconvenient rapidity. The chief command was given to the
Duke of Medina Sidonia, who was " a very good man, but a very
bad sailor," * and knew so little of maritime affairs, that he is
reported to have sent to a dealer in marine stores for an outfit. At
length the INVINCIBLE Armada was ready to put to sea, and they
succeeded in " shoving her off," on the 29th of May, 1588, from the
Tagus. The seas, which evidently had no notion of being ruled by
any but Britannia, turned turbulent under the Spanish usurpers, and
a general rising of the waves made it a toss-up whether Medina
Sidonia and his fleet would ride out the storm in safety. Four of the
ships were actually lost, and nearly all the rest dispersed, and when
the high admiral called upon his subordinate officers to be "calm  
  
  
  * Vide George Cruikshank's renowned etching.
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 156 -->
and collected," he found that the storm had not allowed them to be
either the one or the other.


Having got his forces together again, as well as he could, the
Spanish admiral made another start towards the English coast, and
appeared off the Lizard Point, with his fleet drawn up in the form of
a crescent, being seven miles from horn to horn, and presenting to
the enemy the horns of a dilemma. The English were on shore at
Plymouth, playing at bowls on the Hoe, and Drake, who was getting
the better of the game, declared he would play it out, for there was
no hurry, as he could beat his companions first, and the Spaniards
afterwards. Having at length taken to their vessels, the British
watched their foe as they came rolling in their heavy, lumbering
ships up the Channel. Their guns were planted so high up that they
shot entirely over the English vessels, and into one another, while
their unwieldy size rendering them unmanageable, several of them
were banged to bits by a series of frightful collisions. To add to the
confusion, one of the vessels took fire, and was burnt, by an accident
of the cook on board, who, it has been ingeniously suggested, was
trying to fry some of the celebrated chops of the Channel, " which,"
as Mrs. Markham says, in her very excellent Abridgment, "you
know, my little dears, you have all heard talked about."


Another large vessel sprung her mast, another sprung a leak, a
third burst her binnacle; a fourth shivered her timbers, a fifth lost
all her fore part; and the crew were driven by stern necessity into
the stern; while on all sides, there prevailed the utmost confusion.
Medina Sidonia retired to the back yard of one of his ships, where
he sat dejected and alone, and after a good deal of skirmishing, in
which the Spaniards got the worst of it at all points of the compass,
the duke made the best of his way home again. He arrived at
Santander about the end of September, 1588, with the mere skeleton
of the force he had started with, and every sailor he brought back,
was in himself a complete wreck of what he had been when he
quitted his own country. Thus ended the grand design of invading
England by means of the Spanish Armada, which, to say the truth,
did more mischief to itself than it sustained at the hands of the
enemy. Had a public meeting been held at the time to celebrate the
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 157 -->
victory, we are sure that any English patriot might have proposed a
vote of thanks to the Armada, for the " able and impartial manner
in which it banged itself almost to pieces, with a total disregard ot
its own interests, and to the incalculable advantage of England."


On the 4th of September, 15S8, Leicester, the queen's favourite,
died on his way to Kenilworth; but Elizabeth never felt the loss,
for she had already effected a transfer of her affections to Robert
Devereux, the young Earl of Essex. Her grief at Leicester's death
was so slight, that it did not prevent her from putting an execution
into his house, sweeping off all he had, under a bill of sale, and
submitting it to the public hammer, in order to repay herself the sums
she had advanced to him in his life-time. Essex was a mere boy,
and the part of favourite to a disagreeable ugly old woman like "our
Bessy," was by no means a sinecure. He was expected to appear at
all times as the light comedian of the Court, and was compelled to
exercise flattery and gallantry towards a harridan who neither
justified the one nor inspired the other. He took the earliest
opportunity of getting away from her for a short time, by going to sea
against her express orders; but he would have braved anything for
a respite from the society of the royal bore, whose fondness had
become odious to its object, though policy restrained him from
openly saying so. On his return home, he found himself almost cut
out of the queen's good graces by Sir Walter Raleigh, whose name
we have already mentioned as that of a young adventurer.


Raleigh was a distinguished navigator, which does not mean that
he worked on the cuttings of a railway; but that he belonged to a
very humble line, is a point there is not a doubt upon. His
reputation rests chiefly on the luggage he brought with him after one of his
voyages, when some potatoes, and a few ounces of tobacco crammed
into his sac de nuit, were destined to hand him down to immortality.
The most popular vegetable the world ever saw, has put Raleigh
into everybody's mouth; and when we see the cloud rising from the
cigar, our imagination may trace, in the " smoke that so gracefully
curls," the name of one whose renown cannot be whiffed away into
the regions of oblivion. The jealousy of Essex caused Raleigh to
be sent into Ireland, where he remained for years; and his long
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 158 -->
sojourn may account for the hold that the potato had taken upon the
affections of the Irish people. His rival being thus summarily got
rid of, Essex was left to make his way with the "virgin queen," who
was now verging on old age, and treated her young favourite less
as a subject than a son; for she had come to that time of life when
anything she could show in the shape of fondness deserved the
epithet of motherly. The boy was a fine one of his age, being brave
and good-looking; but Burleigh and other wise counsellors, seeing
that Essex made a fool of the queen, or rather, that she made a fool of
herself by her partiality for him, took a dislike to the stripling. On
one occasion, old Elizabeth, getting kittenish and playful, boxed the
boy's ear, which tingled with the pain—for her hand had become
bony from age—when he laid his hand upon his sword, and was thrown
into disgrace, like a child who has been guilty of naughtiness. He
was soon recalled, and promising that he would " never do so any
more," he rapidly resumed his place in the favour of the royal dotard.


The death of Burleigh, on the 4th of August, 1598, for whom the
hurly-burly of politics had been too much, left the entire field to
Essex, and he made the most of it, by getting the appointment of
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; from which he derived the double
advantage of advancing his own views and getting away from Elizabeth.
He took with him a considerable force, which he somehow or other
frittered away without doing any good whatever; and after losing
several of his soldiers by marching them completely off their legs, he
determined that he must have " a truce to such an unpleasant sort of
thing," and entered at once into a truce with the enemy.


Elizabeth, who had calculated upon his settling the Irish question
at the point of the sword, was disgusted at his failure, and desired
him not to come home till he had subjected his honour to thorough
repair, and taken all the stains out of his character. As he had
no relish for the task imposed upon him, he suddenly quitted his
post, and hastening to England, arrived at the palace covered
with mud and dirt, for he had made a regular steeple-chase of the
latter part of his journey. Without going home to change his boots,
he rushed into the presence-chamber before the queen was up, and
without asking any questions, he pushed his way to her
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 159 -->
dressingroom. He found her completely en deshabille, and started back at
finding her hair on a block before her, instead of on her head, for
she had got her wig in hand, and was trying to turn and twist it
into a becoming form, by means of powder, pomatum, tongs, combs,
and curl-papers. Startled by his sudden appearance, she hastened
to put herself to rights as well as she could, and was angry at the
intrusion; but as he fell at her feet, she contrived to cover the
baldness of her head, and then received him more affably. He had no
sooner gone than she began to reflect upon his presumption in
having thus taken her unawares; and when he returned, after going
home to dress, she would have nothing to say to him.


He was desired to stay at home, and consider himself a prisoner
in his own house; but as the old crone had allowed so many former
familiarities, he was quite unprepared for the game of propriety she
was now practising. He went home and took to his bed, for it made
him perfectly sick to witness the sudden prudery of the queen, who,
during his illness, sent him a daily basin of broth from her own table.
She ordered eight eminent physicians to consult on his case; but
this calling in of a powerful medical force looks very much as if she
had been disposed to get rid of him, and preferred physic to law
for once, as a method of destruction. In spite of his eight doctors
Essex got better, and sent submissive messages, to which Elizabeth
turned a deaf ear; and Essex, by attributing her deafness to age,
irritated her beyond expression. He was told that he would find
her unbending; when he at once replied that he had found her bent
nearly double, when he last had the honour of seeing her, and he
was glad to hear that royalty was once more beginning to look up in
England, by taking its proper position.


These remarks irritated Elizabeth beyond expression; and having
brought him before the privy council, she caused a sentence of
banishment to be inflicted upon him, which he sarcastically declared was
agreeable to him, as it would keep from him the sight of Elizabeth,
whom he now denominated his " old queene." Anxious to try the
effect of intimidation upon the nervous septuagenarian who now sat
upon the throne, he entered into a conspiracy with Scotland; but it
was soon found out, and rushing with desperate fury into the streets,
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 160 -->
he tried to raise a mob by addressing inflammatory speeches to the
populace. The citizens looked at him and listened to him, but
shaking their heads, passed on, when he soon found out that a solo
movement unsupported by any concerted piece, rendered him truly
ridiculous. At length he was hurried off to the Tower, and having
been tried, he was condemned to die, though he fully expected the
palsied old creature who held the sceptre in her tremulous hand,
would, in a love-sick mood, decree his pardon.


It is said that in " happier days," when Essex had been in the
habit of striking " the light, the light, the light guitar," to the
tinlike sound of Elizabeth's voice, she had given him a ring, telling him
if ever he fell into disgrace, the return of that ring would obtain his
pardon. Elizabeth was from day to day listening to every knock,
expecting the identical ring, but it never came, and on the 25th of
February, 1601, he was actually beheaded. Elizabeth never held up
her head again; but indeed, as she had long contracted a stoop
from debility and old age, there is nothing astonishing in the fact we
have mentioned. The spectacle of an old woman pining in love after
a mere boy, was revolting enough; but the fact is made doubly
disgusting by the recollection that she had herself caused the death of
the object of her disreputable dotage.


Some time after the execution of Essex, the Countess of
Nottingham was taken ill, and sending for Elizabeth confessed that the
favourite had given the ring before his death to be delivered to the
queen, but that it had been kept back for party purposes. The
sovereign, who was shaking in every limb from ambiguity and
agitation, flew at the Countess of Nottingham in her bed, seized her
by the shoulder, and administered the most violent cuffs that a female
of seventy is capable of bestowing on one who has offended her.
\"Take that—and that—and that—and that—and that! "—was the cry
of the queen, as she suited the action to the word in every instance.
The exertion was too much for the tottering fabric of human frailty,
who threw herself on the floor when she got to her own room, and
refusing to go to bed, rolled about for ten days on a pile of cushions.
Being asked to name her successor, she is said by some to have
specified James; while others maintain that she said nothing.
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 161 -->
When she was too exhausted to oppose her attendants, they got her
into bed, and on the 24th of March, 1603, she died in the seventieth
year of her age, and forty-fifth of her reign.


Many people have a very natural objection to written characters,
but we feel compelled to give a written character of Queen
Elizabeth; and we are sorry to remark, that we can say very little that
will be thought complimentary. In person she was bony, coarse,
muscular and masculine. Tier hair was red, but this she inherited
from her father Henry, and thus her red hair has been said, by that
mountebank, Strype, to have been he-red-hair-tary at that time in the
royal family. She endeavoured, by the aid of dress, to make up for
the unkindness of Nature; and she surrounded herself with a quantity
of hoops, which, as her figure was rather tub-like, may be considered
appropriate. She never gave away her old clothes, and no less than
three thousand dresses were found at her death, the bodies of which,
it is said, would have covered half London at its then size, while the
skirts would have covered all the outskirts. Her portrait is always
drawn with an enormous ruff round her neck, which she adopted, it
is believed, to hide the roughness of her chin, which showed Nature
to be her enemy, for it had bearded her frightfully.


She was exceedingly fond of visiting the houses of the nobility;
but she usually ruined all whom she honoured in this way, by the
expense they were put to in entertaining her. Lord Leicester, who
had her staying with him at Kenilworth, for a few days, nearly
ruined himself in bears, of which he took in a great quantity to bait
for the amusement of his sovereign. In disposition, manners, and
appearance, there was nothing feminine or graceful about Elizabeth;
but Hume, who seems very fond of her, tells us, that in weighing her,
one ought to sink the female and think only of the sovereign. We
cannot, however, understand a person being at the same time a good
queen and a bad woman, unless the woman happens to be somebody
beside herself, when she is obviously unfit to be trusted with the
responsibility of government. Elizabeth had a certain amount of
talent; " for she had," says Hume, " both temper and capacity; "
but capacity seems to have belonged rather to the bony bulkiness
of her unfeminine form, than to the extent of her intellect.  
  
  
  VOL. II. Y
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 162 -->

Her private character was exceedingly disreputable; and her
amorous propensities, which seemed rather to increase with her old
age, rendered her disgusting to her contemporaries, as well as
ridiculous in the eyes of posterity. She was constantly in love with
some stripling about the Court, who when he became... pen passe,
was thrown aside for some more juvenile admirer. There can be no
doubt that the admirable character of Mrs. Skcwton, if we may be
allowed an irreverent allusion to fiction amid the awful solemnities
of fact, is to be attributed to the extensive historical research of Mr.
Dickens, and his intimate acquaintance with the period of the reign
of Elizabeth. It may be admitted that she governed with
considerable firmness; but the praise, such as it is, of " coming it exceedingly
strong," is, after all, a most questionable compliment.


Several of the greatest names in science and literature shed a
glory on Elizabeth's reign; but the most magnificent sunshine, by
falling on a mean object, does not make the object itself in reality
more respectable. Bacon, Shakespeare, Spenser, and others, are
said to have flourished at the time; but we have examined their
autographs with peculiar care, and have seen no symptoms of
flourishing about any one of them. To say they all wrote at the period,
would be true; but to say they flourished is an exaggeration to which
we will not lend ourselves.


The reign of Elizabeth was, at least, considerably in advance of
our own time in one respect, for it is remarkable for the passing of a
Poor Law which, unlike that of the present day, was founded on
the principles of humanity. This blot, however, will, we trust, be
removed in time for a sixth—though not quite quickly enough for a
second, third, fourth, or fifth—edition of this work; for the Spirit of
the Times has doomed the Poor Law to perdition.


Theatres first came into vogue in Elizabeth's reign; and it is a
fact at which our sober reverence for the Swan of Avon takes
considerable alarm, that that ever-to-be-lamented bird was in the habit
of exercising his quills in the neighbourhood of the New Cut, at a
concern called the Globe, where the prices were only twopence to
the pit, and one penny in the gallery. The critics sat on the stage,
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 163 -->
and were furnished with pipes and tobacco—a gentle intimation to
them to " draw it mild " in their notices of the performances. It is
possible, that through the fumes of the tobacco they got a bird's-eye
view of the stage, which was favourable to their performance of their
critical duties. The audience used to read, play at cards, smoke, and
drink, before the performance began; and perhaps, if the piece
happened to be dull, they relieved it by some of those pastimes even
during its progress.


Smoking, which has since reached such universality that every
man one meets is a chimney, and every boy a flue, is known to have
been introduced by Raleigh, who, fearing that his friends would rally
him on the propensity, used to indulge it in secret. One day some
smoke was seen to issue from his apartment, and the people about
him, fearing he was on fire, inundated him with buckets of water
that put him out very seriously, and determined him in future not to
smoke the pipe of privacy. The mode of living was not very
luxurious in Elizabeth's reign, for a glass of ale and a slice of bread
formed the ordinary breakfast, while brawn was an article of general
consumption; and, as Elizabeth was very fond of it, her great brawny
arms are easily accounted for. An attempt has been made to
attribute various graces and accomplishments to Elizabeth, which, even
after attempting to enlarge our credulity, and stir up our organ ot
veneration to its fullest extent, we are unable to give her credit for.
It is said that she played, sang, and danced tolerably well, though
her figure seems to give very weighty testimony against her probable
possession of the last of these accomplishments.


She admired dancing among her courtiers, and she is said to have
promoted Hatton for his terpsichorean efforts, she having once seen
him practising his steps, when she declared that he held himself so
well in the first position, that she would elevate him to the first
position as soon as possible. Elizabeth, though profuse in her own
indulgences, was stingy in the extreme to others, and her accumulation
of old clothes proves a tenacity of bad habits, and a shabbiness
towards her femme de chambre, that are on a par with the other
despicable points in her character.

for Scotland to James,
whom they hailed as the

she had lived so long that he began to think the royal cat had
nine lives, which delayed her final jump much longer than her
minister desired.


Before posting to Scotland, the Lords of the Council had stuck up
several posters about London, proclaiming James I. amid those
shouts which " the boys " are ever ready to lend to any purpose for
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P195_CB00001 -->

which a mob has been got together. The Scotch king was of course
glad to exchange the miserable cane-bottomed throne of his own
country for the comfortably cushioned seat of English royalty; but
he was so wretchedly poor that he could not even start for his new
kingdom till it had yielded him enough to pay his passage thither.
He tried hard to get possession of the crown jewels for his wife, but
the Council would not trust him with the precious treasures. On his
way to his new dominions he was received with that enthusiasm
which a British mob has always on hand for any new object; but he
did not increase in favour upon being seen; for if a good countenance
is a letter of recommendation, James carried in his face a few lines
that said very little in his favour. His legs were too weak for his
body, his eyes too large for their sockets, and his tongue was too big
for his mouth; so that his knees knocked without making a hit, his
pupils could not be restrained by the lash, while his lingual
excrescence caused so many a slip between the cup and the lip, that his
aspect was awkward and disagreeable.


During his journey to London he rode on horseback, but he was
such a bungling equestrian that he was thrown by a sagacious
animal intent on having his fling at the expense of the sovereign.
Besides being ungainly in his person, he did not set it off to the best
advantage, for he was exceedingly dirty; and thus he appeared to be
looking black at everybody, for his face was encrusted in dust, and
though his predecessor, Elizabeth, was very objectionable, he could
not boast of coming to the throne with clean hands. Power was such
a new toy to him that he could not use it in moderation, and he made
knights at the rate of fifty a day, which caused Bacon so far to forget
himself as to utter the silly sarcasm, that there would be a surfeit of
Sirs, if James proceeded in the manner in which he was beginning.


Conspiracies were soon formed against a monarch so weak, and
the ambitious Raleigh, who had been in his youth a mere street
adventurer, thought he could vault over official posts as easily as he
had vaulted over those in the public thoroughfares. His designs
being detected, he was deprived of some of the offices he possessed,
and among others his monopoly of licensing taverns, and retailing
wines, for which his knowledge of the tobacco business had well
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 169 -->
fitted him. He plotted with Grey, a Puritan, Markham, a Papist,
and Cobham, a Nothingarian, to seize the person of the king; but
the tables were turned upon them by the seizure of themselves and
their committal to the Tower. Grey, Cobham, and Markham were

condemned to die; but just as they had laid their heads on the
block, they were axed if they would rather live, and having answered
in the affirmative, they were committed to the Tower with Raleigh
for the remainder of their lives.  
  
  
  The Puritans having complained of ecclesiastical abuses, James
VOL. II. Z
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P197_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 170 -->
ordered a meeting at Hampton Court between the bishops and their
opponents, to talk over their differences. The bishops were allowed
the first innings, and they continued running on for several hours,
when James took the matter up on the same side, and the Puritans
were not allowed to utter a word. After the king had talked himself
out of breath, and his hearers out of patience, Doctor Reynolds
was permitted to take a turn on behalf of the Puritans; but he was
insulted, interrupted, and regularly coughed down before he had
spoken twenty words. The king then exclaimed, " Well, Doctor, is
that all you have to say ? " Upon which the Doctor, being abashed
by the unfairness shown towards him, admitted that he was unwilling
to proceed. James boasted that he had silenced the Puritans; and
so he had, but it was by intimidation and bluster alone that he had
succeeded in doing so.


Encouraged by his triumph over a few trembling sectarians, the
king called Parliament together, expecting to overcome that body;
but he found he had to deal with some very awkward customers.
They questioned his rights, refused his salary, and turned coldly from
a proposition to unite England with Scotland, which they resisted
with a sneering assertion that oil and vinegar would never agree.
Doubting whether he would get much good out of Parliament in the
temper in which he found it, he abruptly closed the session.


The Catholics, who were subjected to much persecution, became
very angry under it, and a gentleman of the name of Catesby, who
had changed his opinions some three or four times, stuck to the last
set with such fury, that he resolved to assist them at all hazards.
His principles had been a mere matter of toss up, but he had settled
down into a Papist at last; and conceiving the idea of destroying
King, Lords, and Commons, at a blow, he expressed himself on the
subject avec explosion, as the French dramatists have it, to Thomas
Winter, a gentleman of Worcestershire, who having been worsted in
all his prospects, cottoned at once to the scheme. The Catholics had
solicited the mediation of the King of Spain, and Winter passed
over to the Netherlands to hear how matters were going on, when
he made himself acquainted at Ostend with a fellow named Guido
Fawkes, who has been equally misinterpreted by "the boys" and
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 171 -->
the historians. It has been usual to describe him as a low
mercenary who got his name of Fawkes or Forks, from his way of
brutally demanding everybody to fork out; but however etymology
may encourage such an interpretation of his name, we must denounce
it as a cruel libel on his character.* The eagerness of the juvenile
mind to adopt any malicious absurdity that is proposed to it, has been
exhibited in the boyish extravagance of making Guido Fawkes a man
of straw, though there is little doubt that he was a man of substance,
and not the mere Will o' the Wisp that constitutes his portrait as we
see him drawn on stone along the paved streets of the metropolis..


Guido, whose pretended ugliness has made his abbreviated name
of Guy synonymous with a frightful object, was a gentleman, though
a fanatic, and it is not true that had Fawkes been invited to dinner,
it would have been necessary to look after the spoons as well as the
Fawkes with unusual vigilance. Catesby invited Winter and Guido
to his lodgings, where they were met by Thomas Percy, a distant
relation of the Earl of Northumberland, and by John Wright, an
obstinate fellow, who would never own himself wrong. Grog and
cigars—the latter being a novelty recently imported by Raleigh—
were liberally provided, when Catesby suggested that before business
could be regularly gone into, an oath of secrecy must be
administered. With a melodramatic desire to give the affidavit all the
advantages of appropriate scenery, it was suggested that a lone
house in the fields beyond Clement's Inn should be the spot where
the oath should be administered.


In the course of a few days the affidavit had been drawn, perused,
settled, and engrossed, when the parties met at the place appointed,
and were all sworn in, with due formality. Catesby, acting as a sort
of chairman, then proceeded to explain to the meeting his views.
He commenced rather in the shape of innuendos, by hinting that he
wished the Parliament further, and he thought he knew a mode of
despatching all the Members at once, by a special train. As his
associates did not take the hint immediately, he proceeded to expatiate


* Some monster or punster in human form, declares he was called Fawkes or
Forks, because he was ready to con-knive in anything sanguinary. The atrocity of
this assertion needs no comment.
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 172 -->
on the expediency of a regular blow up, and getting rid of the
whole Parliament " slap bang; " accompanying his observation by
dealing on the deal table a tremendous thump, that made a noise
resembling the explosion of gunpowder. The action seemed to
strike a light in the eyes of all present, and by putting this and that
together, they perceived that Catesby's intention was to act the last
scene of the Miller and his Men, beneath the walls of Parliament.


Percy, who was a gentleman pensioner—though he seems to have
been rather more of the pensioner than the gentleman—had an
opportunity of hanging about the Court, and watching the
movements of his intended victims. The first care of the conspirators was
to take a house in the neighbourhood; but no one of the lot, except
Percy, had sufficient credit to justify his acceptance as a tenant, by
any prudent landlord. At length they got hold of a dwelling by the
water side, which was occupied by one Ferris—probably a ferryman
■—who, for a small consideration, vacated the premises in Percy's
favour. The back of the house abutted—by means of a water-butt—on
the Parliamentary party wall, and they began picking a hole in the
wall as soon as they obtained possession. At every move they renewed
their oath of secrecy, as if they Avere mutually better known than trusted
among themselves, and a secret which, even in ordinarily honest hands,
is tolerably sure to get wind, was very soon known to twenty people,
at least, through the leakiness of one or more of the conspirators.


Emboldened by their success, they took a coal shed, on the
Lambeth side of the river, where one of them, under pretence of going
into the potato business, accumulated as large a quantity of coals,
coke, and wood, as he could with the small means upon which he was
enabled to speculate. The chief scene of their operations was, of
course, the house at Westminster, where they laid in a large supply
of hard-boiled eggs; " the better," says Strype, " to be enabled to
hatch their scheme, and to avoid suspicion, by not being compelled
to send out for food." The wall offering considerable resistance to
their projects, it was found advisable to send for the keeper of the
potato shed, over the way, to aid in the work, and young Wright,'a
brother of the same Wright that never would admit himself to be
wrong, was admitted to a partnership in the secret.
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 173 -->

Vainly did these ninny-hammers go hammering on at the walls of
Parliament, which stuck together in a manner very characteristic of
bricks, and no impression seemed to be made upon them; while the
mine from Lambeth, by means of which they intended under-mining
the British Constitution, made scarcely any progress at all. One
morning-, in the midst of their labours, they were startled by a
rumbling noise over head, when Guido Fawkes, who acted as sentinel,
ran to ascertain the cause of the alarming sound. It seemed that one
Bright, who carried on the coal business in a cellar immediately below
the Parliament, was clearing out his stock, at "an alarming sacrifice,"
with the intention of moving his business to some more fashionable
neighbourhood. Perhaps he was a bad tenant, and being on the eve
of ejection, removed his coals in revenge for having got the sack from
his landlord; but, at all events, he had a cart into which he was
shooting the Wall's End, though he may have had no intention of shooting
the moon at the expense of his creditors.


Percy, knowing the cellar must be vacant, went to look at it, and
pronounced it the very thing; though it might, naturally, have excited
some surprise that one who had hitherto been considered a man of ton
should become a man of chaldrons and hundredweights, by going
into the coal business, on a scale somewhat limited. A tenancy was
nevertheless effected, and several barrels of gunpowder were carried
into the vault, under the pretence that the small beer and bloater
business was about to be commenced by the new lessee, in a style of
unusual liberality. Guy Fawkes was despatched to Flanders, to
obtain adherents to the scheme, but he got no further than to obtain
a promise from Owen that he would speak to Stanley, which seems
to have been merely equivalent to an extension of the secret, without
any beneficial result to the conspirators. On the return of Guido, he
found that while he had been extending the secret abroad, his
colleagues had been blabbing—of course confidentially—at home, so that
the secret was becoming a good deal like an "aside" in a
melodrama, which comes to the ears of every one but the person most
interested in being made acquainted with its purport.


Every arrangement was now made for blowing up the
Parliament sky-high, when a prorogation, until the fifth of November, was
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 174 -->
suddenly announced, and the conspirators began to fear that the
secret, which had experienced as many extensions as a railway line,
had found its way, by some disagreeable deviation, to the ears of the
intended victims. The expense of the conspiracy had hitherto
been borne by Catesby, who paid for all the hard-boiled eggs, the
rent of the coal-cellar, with the wood and the coals that had been
had in; for, the rest, being soldiers of fortune, which means that they
were soldiers of no fortune at all, would not have got credit for even
the bull's-eye lanthorn, which has since cut such a conspicuous figure
in the history of the period.


Catesby had, however, spent so much in new-laid eggs and
newlaid gunpowder—for he had to support a numerous train—that he
was obliged to take in fresh capital, and Sir Everard Digby, with
Francis Tresham, were admitted as shareholders in the dangerous
secret. Digby put down fifteen hundred pounds on the allotment of
a slice of the mystery to himself, and Francis Tresham, who did not
much like the speculation, though he consented to enter into it, gave
his cheque for two thousand pounds, saying that he considered the
money thrown away as completely as if he had wasted it in
horsechestnuts, Venetian grog, or raspberry vinegar. His givings were
accompanied by fearful misgivings, and he never expected to see the
hour when he should have the honour of being sent up to posterity on
the wings of a barrel of gunpowder.


The fifth of November was the day that the conspirators had
agreed to immortalize, for the benefit of future dealers in squibs,
crackers, Catharine-wheels, and all the other " wheels within
wheels," that are so completely in character with this complicated
project. They used to take blows on the river preliminary to the
great blow they had in their eye, and a house at Erith was their
frequent place of rendezvous. They also held consultations at White
Webbs—not Webb's the White Bear—near Enfield, and here they
arranged that Guido Fawkes, after putting matters in train, should
set fire to it, by a slow-burning match, which would give him time to
escape, though he often said, half-jestingly, that to find his match
would be exceedingly difficult. As the scheme drew near its
intended execution, the " secret " had become so fearfully divided
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 175 -->
that every one who possessed a share of it had some friend or other
he wanted to save; and, if each had been allowed to withdraw his
man, the residue of the Parliament would scarcely have been worth
the powder and shot it had been determined to devote to them.


Tresham, for example, was seized with a sudden fit of
benevolence towards old Lord Monteagle; while Kay, the seedy and needy
gentleman in charge of the house at Lambeth, wanted to save Lord
Mordaunt, who had cashed for poor K. an I.O.U., when the money
was of great use to him. Catesby, who was not so tender-hearted,
declared it was all very well, but if they were to go on saving and
excepting one after the other, there could be no explosion at all,
unless they could procure some of that celebrated discriminating
gunpowder, which blows up all the villains, in the last scene of a
melodrama, and spares the virtuous characters. He insisted,
therefore, on the necessity of leaving the result to a toss-up, as at a
game of heads and tails, in which all would have an equal chance of
winning or losing.


Tresham, who combined the wavering of the weathercock with
the tremulousness of the tee-to-tum, was still intent on giving a sort
of general warning to a number of his friends, and when his blabbing
was objected to, he declared the affair had better be put off, as he
could find no more money to carry on the conspiracy. Catesby,
Winter, and Fawkes objected to delay; whereupon it is supposed
that Tresham not only ratted but let the cat out of the bag in a most
unwarrantable manner. Lord Monteagle, who had a country box at
Hoxton, was giving a petit souper to a few friends on the 26th of
October, and he was just finishing the leg of a Welsh rabbit, when his
page presented him a letter that had just been left by a tall man
who had refused to leave his name or wait for an answer. Lord
Monteagle, thinking it might be a bill, desired one of his guests to
read it out, when it proved to be a letter written in the characteristic
spelling of the period. " I would advyse' yowe, as yowe tender
yower lyf, to devyse some excuse to shift of yower attendance at this
parleament," said the anonymous scribbler, which threw Monteagle
into such alarm that he took the Hoxton 'bus, and went off to
Whitehall the same evening to see Cecil. The king was " hunting
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 176 -->
the fearful hare at Royston," in the most hare-um scare-um style,
and it was resolved that nothing could, would, or should be done
until the return of the sovereign.


Notwithstanding the letter having been delivered as early as the
26th of October, nothing seems to have been done to stop the
conspiracy, for Fawkes went regularly once a day to the cellar, to
count the coals, snuff the rushlight, and do any other little odd job
that the progress of the conspiracy might require. Cecil and Suffolk
having laid their heads together on the subject of the letter, at last
fancied they had found the solution of the riddle, which, for the
convenience of the student, we will throw into the form of a charade,
after an approved model:—■  
  
  
  My first is a sort of peculiar tea;  
  
  
  My second a lawn or a meadow might be;
My whole's a conspiracy likely to blow  
  
  
  King, Commons, and Lords to a place I don't know.

The "peculiar tea" was gunpowder, the "lawn" or "meadow" was
a plot—of grass, and the whole was the gunpowder plot, which
though it went off very badly at the time, caused an explosion from
which the country has not yet quite recovered. Notwithstanding the
solution of the mystery, no steps were taken to bring" the matter to
an issue, and Fawkes was permitted to be at large about town,
paying his diurnal visits to the cellar without attracting the
observation of any one. Tresham and Winter talked the matter over in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, or wandered amid the then romantic scenery of
Whetstone Park, to consult on the scheme and its probable
completion. The timid Tresham proposed flight, but his
fellow-conspirators, who were not so flighty, resolved on persevering, and
the intrepid Fawkes kept up a regular Cellarius,* by dancing
backwards and forwards about the cellar.


The shilly-shallying of all parties with respect to the gunpowder
conspiracy is one of the most remarkable features of the period when


* We may as well state, for the benefit of that posterity which this work will reach
and the Cellarius will not, that the Cellarius is a dance fashionable in the year 1847,
when this history was written.
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 177 -->
it occurred; for we find the plotters, with detection staring them in
the face, adhering to their old haunts, while the intended victims,
though made aware of the plot, were as tardy as possible in taking
any steps to baffle it. Fawkes continued his visits to the cellar just as
confidently as ever; and one would think that ultimately detection
was the object he had in view, for he lurked about the premises with
such obstinate perseverance that his escape was impossible.


At length Suffolk, the Lord Chamberlain, took Monteagle down
to the House the day before the opening of Parliament, to see that
all was right, and they occupied themselves for several hours in
looking under the seats, unpicking the furniture of the throne to
see if any one was concealed inside, and searching into every hole
and corner where a conspirator was not likely to secrete himself.
Having taken courage from the fact of there being no signs of
danger, they determined to go down stairs into the cellar, under
pretence of stopping up the rat-holes—for even in those early days
rats found their way into the House—and they had no sooner
opened the door than they saw in one corner a round substance,
which they at first took for a beer-barrel. They approached it with
the intention of giving it a friendly tap, when the supposed barrel
rose up into the height of a water-butt.


Suffolk instantly got behind Monteagle, who stood trembling
with fear, when the phantom cask assumed the form of a " tall
desperate fellow," who proved to be Fawkes, and the Chamberlain,
affecting a careless indifference, demanded his " name, birth, and
parentage." Guido handed his card, bearing the words G. Fawkes,
and announced himself as the servant of Mr. Percy, who carried on
a trade in coals, coke, and wood, if he could, in the immediate
neighbourhood. "Indeed," said Suffolk, "your master has a tolerably
large stock on hand, though I think there is something else screened
besides the coals, which I see around me." Without adding another
word, he and Monteagle ran off, and Fawkes hastened to acquaint
Percy with what had happened.


Poor Guido seems to have formed a most feline and most fatal
attachment to the place, for nothing could keep him out of the cellar,
though he knew he was almost certain of being hawled,uncereVOL. II. a A
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 178 -->
moniously, over the coals, and he went back, at two in the morning,
to the old spot, with his habitual foolhardiness. He had no sooner
opened the door than he was seized and pinioned, without his opinion
being asked, by a party of soldiers. He made one desperate effort to
make light of the whole business, by setting fire to the train, but he
had no box of Congreves at hand, and he observed, with bitter
boldness, in continuation of a pun which he had made in happier days,
that he had at last found his match and lost his Lucifer.


Poor Guy Fawkes, having been bound hand and foot, was taken
on a stretcher to Whitehall, having been previously searched, when
his pocket was found filled with tinder, touch-wood, and other similar
rubbish. Behind the door was a dark lanthorn, or bull's-eye, that
had cowed the soldiers at first glance, by its glazed look, but it
seemed less terrible on their walking resolutely up to it. Fawkes
was taken to the king's bed-room, at Whitehall, and though his
limbs were bound and helpless, he spoke with a thick, bold, ropy
voice, that terrified all around him. His tones had become quite
sepulchral, from remaining so long in the vault, and when asked his
name, he scraped out from his hoarse throat the words " John
Johnson," which came gratingly—as if through a grating—on the ears of
the bystanders. He announced himself as John the footman to Mr.
Percy, and he threw himself into an attitude—which was rather
cramped by his pinions—which he found anything but the sort
of pinions that would enable him to soar into the lofty regions of
romance to which he had aspired. He nevertheless boldly announced
his purpose, with the audacity of a stage villain; and with that sort
of magnanimity which lasts, on an average, about five minutes, in
the guilty breast, he refused to disclose the names of his accomplices.


One of the Scotch courtiers who had a natural feeling of
stinginess, asked how it was that Fawkes had collected so many barrels of
gunpowder, when half the quantity would have done ? upon which
Fawkes replied, that his principal had desired him to purchase
enough to blow the Scotch back to Scotland. " Hoot, awa, mon ! "
rejoined the Scot; " but ken ye not that ye might have bought half
the powder, and put the rest of the siller in your pocket r" Fawkes
sternly intimated that though he would have blown up the
<!-- Leaf 207 -->
Parlia
v y^yyr
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P207_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 179 -->
ment, he would not defraud his principal. " Hoot, raon ! " cried the
Scotchman, who loved his specie under the pretence of loving his
species, and who, it is probable, belonged to the Chambers; " Hoot,
mon!" he whined, " dinna ye ken that there are times when you
mun just throw your preencipal overboard ?"*


On the 6th of November, Fawkes was sent to the Tower, with
instructions to squeeze out of him whatever could be elicited by the
screw, which was then the usual method of scrutiny. For four days
he would confess nothing at all; but his accomplices began to
betray themselves by their own proceedings. Several of them fled;
but Tresham exhibited the very height of impudence by coming
down to the Council and asking if he could be of any use in the
pursuit of the rebels. Nothing but the effrontery of the boots which
ran after the stolen shoes, crying " Stop thief!" and have never
returned to this very hour, can be compared with the coolness of
Tresham in offering to aid in effecting the capture of the conspirators.


Catesby and Jack Wright cut right away to Dunchurch, Percy filled
his purse, and Christopher Wright packed up his kit, to be in
readiness for making off when occasion required, while Keyes made a
precipitate bolt out of London the morning after the plot was discovered.
Rookwood, who had ordered relays of fine horses all along the road,
went at full gallop through Highgate, and never slackened his pace
till he reached Turvey, in Bedfordshire, where he came tumbling
almost topsy-turvy over the inhabitants. Arriving at Ashby, St.
Legers, with a legercte quite worthy of the race for the St. Leger
itself, he had already travelled eighty miles in six hours; but he
nevertheless pushed along on his gallant steed—a magnificent dun
—who always ran as if he had a commercial dun at his heels, to
Dunchurch. Here he found Digby, enjoying his otium cum dig.—
with a hunting party round him; but the guests guessed what was
in the wind, and fearing they might come in for the blow, had
vanished in the night-time. When Digby sat down to breakfast the
next day, his circle of friends had dwindled to a triangle, consisting
of Catesby, Percy, and Rookwood, who, with their host, now become

<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 180 -->
almost a host in himself, took speedily to horse, and rode a regular
steeple-chase to the borders of Staffordshire. Here they arrived on
the night of November the 7th, at Holbeach, where they took
possession of a house; but by this time Sir Richard Walsh, the sheriff
of Worcester, who had got writs out against them all, was close
upon them with his officers.  
  
  
  Flight of Rookwood


In the morning their landlord, one Littleton, having been let into
their secret, let himself out of his bed-room window through fear, and
Digby decamped under the pretence of going to buy some eggs to
suck for breakfast, as well as to look for some succour. Digby had
hardly shut the street door when its bang was echoed by a bang up
stairs, occasioned by Catesby, Percy, and Rookwood having
endeavoured to dry some gunpowder in a frying pan over the fire.
Catesby was burnt and blackened, besides being blown up for having
been the chief cause of the accident; and shortly afterwards, to add
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P210_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 181 -->
to their misfortunes, the sheriff, with the posse comitatus, surrounded
the dwelling. The conspirators endeavoured to parry with their
swords the bullets of their assailants, but this was a hopeless job, and
keeping up their spirits as well as they could, they exclaimed at every
shot fired on the side of the king, " Here comes another dose of
James's powder."


Catesby, addressing Thomas Winter, roared out, " Now then,
stand by me, Tom! " and Winter, suddenly taking a spring to his
friend's side, they were both shot by one musket. Their attendants,
not being able to get the bullet out, issued a bullet-in to say they
were both dead, and the brothers Wright were not long left to
bewail the fate of their accomplices. Percy, who had persevered
to the last, got a wound which wound him up, and Rookwood had
received such a home-thrust in the stomach from a rusty pike,
that the pike rust sadly disagreed with him. Digby, whose feelings
had run away with him, was overtaken, caught, and made fast,
because he had been too slow, while Keyes came to a dead-lock,
and the prisoners being all brought to London, were lodged in
the Tower.


Tresham, who had never left town, but was strutting about with
all the easy confidence of a man with " nothing out against him,"
was suddenly nabbed, in spite of his remonstrances, conveyed in
exclamations of " What have I done ?" " La ! bless me ! there must
be some mistake ! " and other appeals of an ejaculatory but useless
character.


Poor Guido Fawkes was examined by Popham, Coke, and Wood,
whose names may now for the first time be noticed as appropriate to
the business they were intrusted with. Popham is surely
emblematical of the series of pops, bangs, and explosions that would have
ensued from the Gunpowder Plot; while Coke and Wood are
obviously symbolical of the combustibles required for fuel. In vain
did these sagacious persons attempt to get anything from Guido, who
said " he belonged to the Fawkes and not to the spoons, who might
perhaps be made to convict themselves by cross-questioning."
Popham popped questions in abundance; Coke tried to coax out the
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 182 -->
truth; and Wood, if he could, would have got at the facts; but
neither threats nor promises could prevent Fawkes from showing his
metal. Posterity, in altering his name to Guy Fox, has happily hit
upon and appropriately expressed the cunning of his character. He
confessed his own share in the business readily enough, but resolutely

refused to betray his associates. " I will not acknowledge that Percy
is in the plot," he cried; which reminds us of an intimation made by
a gentleman just arrested, to his surrounding friends, that " he did
not wish the bailiff pumped upon." A nod is as good as a wink in
certain cases; and like winking the sheriff's officer was submitted to
a course of hydropathic treatment. In the same manner the
declaration of Fawkes that " Percy had nothing to do with it—oh dear no,
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P212_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 183 -->
nothing at all! " was quite enough to put the authorities on the
right scent had any such guidance been required.


Poor Fawkes was so fearfully damaged by the torture he had
undergone, that his handwriting was entirely spoiled; and specimens
of his mode of signing his name after the torture, contrasted with the
copy of his autograph before the cruel infliction, present the reverse
of the result which writing-masters of our day boast of producing by
their six lessons in penmanship.


Guido Fawkes, however, confessed nothing specifically beyond
what the Government already knew, but Tresham and Catesby's
servant, Bates, a man remarkable for his betise, confessed whatever
the authorities required. Tresham being seized with a fatal illness
in prison, retracted his confession, which he declared had been
extorted or "extortured"—as Strype has it—from him, and he died
after placing his recantation in the hands of his wife to be given
to Cecil. The surviving conspirators were brought to trial after
some delay, and though they all pleaded not guilty, as long as
there was a chance of escape, they were no sooner convicted beyond
all hope than they began boasting of their offence, and were all " on
the high ropes " when they came to the scaffold. Garnet the Jesuit
was served up by way of garniture to the horrible banquet that the
vengeance of the Protestants required. This brilliant character
shone with increased lustre as the time for his execution approached,
and however glorious had been his rise, the setting was worthy of
Garnet in his very brightest moments.


Besides those who were executed for an avowal, or at least, a
proved participation in the Gunpowder Plot, several persons were
punished very severely, in the capacity of supplementary victims,
who might, or might not, have been implicated in the conspiracy.
Lords Mordaunt and Stourton, two Catholic nobles, were fined,
respectively, ten thousand and four thousand pounds, because they
did not happen to be in their places in Parliament, to be blown up,
had Fawkes succeeded in accomplishing his object. The Earl of
Northumberland was sent to the Tower for a few years, and mulcted
of thirty thousand pounds, because he had made Percy a gentleman
pensioner, some years before; but no trouble was taken to show
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 184 -->
how this could have rendered him afterwards a rebel, nor how
Northumberland could be responsible, even if such a result had
really arrived. But it was urged by the apologists for this severity,
that the Gunpowder Treason would have been fatal alike to the
good and the bad, and that as the punishment should correspond
with the offence, an indiscriminate dealing out of penalties among
the guilty and the innocent was quite allowable.

<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 185 -->

James, who saw the advantage Scotland would derive from an
alliance with England, began to urge the Union, but the English
naturally objected to such a very unprofitable match; for Scotland
had nothing to lose, nothing to give, nothing to lend, and nothing
to teach, except the art of making bread without flour, joke-books
without wit, reputation without ability, and a living without
anything. James felt that the sarcasms on the Scotch were personal to
himself, and he told the Parliament they ought not to talk on matters
they did not understand; but it was thought that to restrict them to
subjects which they did understand, would be equivalent to depriving
them of liberty of speech on nearly every occasion.


James had become somewhat popular on account of the attempt
to blow him up sky-high with all his ministers, and a rumour of his
having been assassinated sent him up a shade or two higher in the
affections of his people. It is a feature in the character of the
English that they always take into their favour anyone who seems
to be an object of persecution; and there is no doubt that if in a
crowd there is anyone desirous of rising in public esteem, he has
only to ask a friend to give him a severe and apparently unmerited
blow on the head, in order to render him the idol of the surrounding
multitude. If there had been no Gunpowder Plot, it would have
been worth the while of James to have got one up, for the express
purpose of increasing his popularity. His qualities, as shown in his
way of life at this time, do not warrant the esteem in which he was
held; for he divided his time between the pleasures of the table, the
excitements of the chase, and the blackguardism of the cock-pit.


When remonstrated with on the lowness of his pursuits, he
declared that his health required relaxation; and he would declare that
he would rather see one of his Dorking chickens win his spurs, than
witness the grandest tournament. These pursuits, which were
expensive, caused him to do many acts of meanness to obtain the
necessary supplies : and among other things he went to dine with
the Clothworkers as well as with the Merchant Tailors, among both
of whom the royal hat was sent round at the close of the banquet.
At the second of these entertainments his own beaver had just made
the circuit of the table with considerable effect, when, encouraged by  
  
  
  VOL. II. B B
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 186 -->
the liberality of the company, he shoved on to the social board a
cap, in the name of his son, Prince Henry. The collection for the
child was not very ample, for many of the guests objected to being
called upon for a trifle towards lining the pockets of the young
gentleman's new frock, more especially when it was obvious that James
fully intended to clutch the whole of the additional assets.


Among other disreputable methods he took of procuring money,
was the institution of the order of Baronets, whose titles he sold at a
thousand pounds each, without regard to the merit of the purchasers.
The antiquity of a baronetcy is therefore not much in its favour, and
those who can trace the possession of such a distinction in their
family down to the first establishment of the rank, do nothing more
than prove the possession, either honestly or dishonestly, of a
thousand pounds by one of his ancestors. Seventy-five families took
advantage of this traffic in dignities to obtain a sort of spurious
nobility, founded on the necessities of the sovereign. The only
qualifications required of candidates wishing to be elected to the
order were " cash down," to pay the fees, and an ability to trace a
descent from at least a grandfather on the father's side; so that
scmblc, as the lawyers say, the maternal ancestors might have been
utterly hypothetical and purely anonymous. The arms of the
baronets have always included those of Ulster, because the money
they contributed was designed for the relief of that province—
a proof that Ireland has been a drain upon England for a
lonoseries of centuries. The emblem of Ulster is a bloody hand, which
was only too appropriate to the place; and the symbol being called
in the language of heraldry a hand gules—or gold—in a field argent
—or silver—was also characteristic of the metallic source from which
the baronets derived their titles.


Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, had long been looked upon
as a pleasing contrast to his odious father, and the people were
anticipating the former's reign with an assurance that the amiable and
accomplished son would compensate for the infliction they had
endured in the ignorance, pride, and selfishness of the parent.
Death, however, that sometimes seizes first on the best, and leaves
the worst till the last—on the principle of the boy who began by
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 187 -->
picking all the plums out of the pudding—took the youthful prince
before appropriating his papa, and caused the latter sinfully to exult
in being the survivor of his own offspring. He forgot the maxim
that " Whom the gods love, die young," and the remarks he made
upon his own comparative longevity proved that he at least was  
  
  
  
King James disposing of Baronetcies.

one of those whom the gods had not been anxious to adopt at the
earliest opportunity. The young prince died of a malignant fever,
on the 5th of November, 1612, and his father, whose harsh conduct—
especially to Sir Walter Raleigh and other great men—had been
criticised by his heir, allowed no mourning to take place, but made
the unnatural and blasphemous boast that " he should outlive all
who opposed him."


Though having little or no affection for his own children, James
delighted in having about him some low and sneaking favourite who
would flatter his ridiculous vanity, and help to cheat him into the
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P217_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 188 -->
belief that he was a good and amiable character. As no one of
spirit and honesty would consent to become the despicable parasite
that James required, some mean and unprincipled vagabond was of
necessity selected as the depositary of that confidence which a son,
with the feelings of a gentleman, could not of course participate.


Henry had therefore been excluded from that free communication
which should exist between child and parent in every station, and
an uneducated humbug named Robert Carr had wormed his way
into the heart, or rather into the favour of James, who-was drawn
towards the other by a sympathy with congenial littleness. Carr
was such a wretched ignoramus as to be unable to speak ten
consecutive words of grammar, and it flattered the egregious vanity of
James to be able to impart some of that education of which he had
just about enough to enable him to show his superiority over his
most unlettered pupil. Carr played his cards so successfully that he
was soon not only knighted but created Viscount Rochester; and
though his future career proved him worthier of the rope, he actually
obtained the garter.


It was to be presumed that this disreputable scapegrace would
soon do something or other to prove how far James had been right
or wrong in the selection of a friend, adviser, companion, and
favourite. The necessities of Carr were so well supplied by sponging
on his royal patron that it was not necessary for the former to
commit any pecuniary swindle; but he very rapidly got into a most
disgraceful connection with the Countess of Essex, a vile person who
obtained a divorce from her own husband, to enable her to marry
Rochester. The latter had a friend named Sir Thomas Overbury,
who advised him to have nothing to do with the profligate woman
in question. This so irritated the countess that she persuaded her
paramour to join her in poisoning the party who had given the
advice, and after trying the homœopathic principle for some weeks
without effect, they at length gave him one tremendous dose which
did the atrocious business. Carr had received the title of Earl of
Somerset on his infamous marriage, but the favourite was getting
already a little out of favour when the affair of the murder happened.
James, being one of those who promptly turned his back on those
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 189 -->
who were " down in the world," and had smiles for those only who
were prosperous, began to estrange himself from Somerset, and to
transfer his worthless friendship to George Villiers, afterwards Duke
of Buckingham.


The king first saw this young scamp at the Theatre Royal,
Cambridge, where a five-act farce called Ignoramus was being represented
by a party of distinguished amateurs, with the applause that usually
attends these interesting performances. Villiers was appointed
cupbearer— a grade immediately under that of bottle-holder—to the
king, and the influence of the new favourite was soon felt by the old,
who found himself arrested one fine morning on the charge of having
been concerned in Sir Thomas Overbury's murder. The steps taken
for the punishment of this atrocity were perfectly characteristic of
the period. By way of a preliminary offering to Justice, some
halfdozen of the minor and subordinate parties to the crime were
executed off-hand, while the two principal delinquents, Somerset and
his countess, having been tardily condemned, were immediately
afterwards pardoned. The infamous couple subsequently received a
pension of four thousand a year from the king, who no doubt felt
that Somerset could show him up, and was just the sort of scoundrel
to do so unless he could be well paid for his silence. The annuity
allowed to the ex-favourite must be looked upon as hush-money,
rendered necessary by the mutual rascalities of the donor and the
recipient, who being in each other's power, were under the necessity
of effecting a compromise. The fall of Somerset was followed by the
rise of Villiers, who rushed through the entire peerage with railroad
rapidity, passing the intermediate stations of Viscount, Earl, and
Marquis, till he reached the terminus as Duke of Buckingham.


Poor Raleigh, who had been thirteen years in the Tower, where
he was writing the History of the World, began to feel a very natural
anxiety to get out of his prison, and describe, from ocular
demonstration, the subject of his gigantic labours. He accordingly spread
a report that he knew of a gold mine in Guiana, where the stuff for
making guineas could be had only for the trouble of picking it up,
and the king was persuaded to let him go and try his luck in
America. Raleigh had no sooner got free than he published a
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 190 -->
prospectus and got up a company with a preliminary deposit sufficient
to start him off well on his new enterprise. He proved with all the
clearness of figures—which the reader must not think of confounding
with facts—that a hundred per cent, must be realised; and the shares
in Raleigh's gold mine rose to such a height that he was enabled to
rig a ship after having rigged the market. Plans were published
with great streaks of gamboge painted all over, to represent the
supposed veins of gold that were waiting only to be worked; and through
the medium of these veins the British public bled very rapidly.


The extent of the mining mania got up by Sir Walter may be
imagined when we state that he arrived with twelve vessels at
Guiana, a portion of which had already been taken possession of by
Spain; and the English speculators declared with disgust, that they
had come for the gold, and had not expected to meet the Spanish.
The town of St. Thomas being already in the possession of the
latter, was boldly attacked and ultimately taken, but instead of
finding a mine there were only two ingots of gold in the whole place,
which Raleigh clutched, exclaiming " Those are mine," immediately
on landing. It was evident to the whole party that Raleigh's story
of the gold mine was a mere " dodge " to get himself released from
the Tower; and when they came to look for the boasted vein, they
found that it was literally in vain that they searched for the precious
metal. A mutiny at once broke out, and as Raleigh deceived them
in his promise of introducing them to abundance of gold, they made
him form a very close connection with a large quantity of iron.
They in fact threw him into fetters, a species of treatment that, had
it been applied to every projector of a bubble company during the
railway mania of 1846, would have hung half the aldermen of
London in chains, and linked society together by a general
concatenation of nearly every rank as well as every profession. Poor Raleigh
arrived safe in Plymouth Sound, but he found a proclamation out
against him, accusing him of a long catalogue of crimes, and inviting
all the world to take him into custody.


The Spanish ambassador was at the bottom of this affair, for the
Spaniards had a score of old scores against Sir Walter, who had no
sooner landed at Plymouth than he was made a prisoner. With
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 191 -->
considerable ingenuity he pretended to be very ill, and even feigned
insanity; but the latter was a plea that could not so easily be
established in the time of Raleigh as it has been in our own days, when it
has been found a convenient and effective excuse for those who,
having committed murder, escape on the ground of their being given
to eccentricity. Raleigh tried it on very hard, by talking
incoherently, playing the fool, dancing fandangos in his prison, sending a
potato to his tailor to be measured for a new jacket, and feigning
other acts of madness, but to the writ dc lunatico tnqutrendo, there
was no other return than nullum Her, or no go, when the
investigation into his state of mind was concluded. In order to save the
trouble and expense of a fresh conviction, the old outstanding
judgment was again brought up, and it was determined to kill him
by a bill of reviver—if such an anomaly could be permitted. He
grew ponderously facetious as his end drew nigh, and made one or
two jokes that might have saved him had they been heard in time,
for they gave evidence of an amount of mental imbecility that should
have released him from all responsibility on account of his actions.


Among other lugubrious levities of Raleigh before his death, was
the well-known but generally-execrated remark in reference to a cup
of sack which was brought to him : " Ha! " said he, "I shall soon
have the sack without the cup; " an observation that elicited, as soon
as it was known, an immediate order for his execution. " That head
of Raleigh's must come off," cried the king, " for it is evident the fellow
has lost the use of it." On the 29th of October, 1618, poor Raleigh
joked his last, upon the scaffold, where he stood shivering with cold,
when the sheriff asked him to step aside for a few minutes and warm
himself. " No," said Sir Walter, " my wish is to take it cool; " and
then looking at the axe, he balanced it on the top of his little
finger—some say his chin—and observed, " This is a great medicine,
rather sharp, but it cures all diseases." At this the headsman, no
doubt irritated by the maddening mediocrity of the intended
witticism, let fall the fatal blade, and Raleigh, with his head off, never
came to—or rather, never came one—again.


We ought, perhaps, to shed a tear over the fate of this great,
though unprincipled man; but it is not so easy to turn on the main

of sentiment to the fountains of pity, after the water has been cut off
during more than two centuries by Time, in the capacity of turncock.
Besides, in going through the history of our native land there are so
many victims, all more or less worthy of a gush of sympathy, that we
should literally dissolve ourselves in tears before we had got half
through our labours, if we began giving way to what old King Lear
has ungallantly termed a woman's weakness.

Bennet, Judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and Field,
Bishop of Llandaff, were convicted of bribery. Yelverton, the
Attorney-General, was found guilty of having aided in an extensive
swindle in the Patent Office, and Bacon, the great " moral
philosopher," was found to have been fleecing the public in the Court of
Chancery, to such a degree, that he might have stuffed the woolsack
over and over again from the produce of the shearing to which he
submitted the flocks of suitors who appealed to him. He would take
bribes in open court, and he would pretend to consider, that as all
men should be equal in the eye of the law, the equality could only be
achieved by emptying the pockets of every party that came into
court, as a preliminary to giving him a hearing-.


It has been said by his apologists, that though he took bribes, his
decisions were just, for he would often give judgment against those
who had paid him for a decree in their favour. The excuse merely
proves that he was sufficiently unscrupulous to follow up one fraud
by another, and to cheat his suitors out of the consideration upon
which they had parted with their money. Bacon endeavoured to
effect a compromise with his accusers by a confession of about one
per cent, of his crimes, but the Peers insisted on making him
answerable in full for all his delinquencies. He then acknowledged
twenty-eight articles, which seemed to satisfy the most ravenous of
his enemies, who were hungering to see his reputation torn to pieces
by the million mouths of rumour. The great seal was taken away
from a man of such a degraded stamp, he was fined forty thousand
pounds—a mere bagatelle out of what he had bagged—was declared
incapable of holding office or sitting in Parliament, and was sent off
to the Tower.


There were thoughts of beheading him, but happily for England,
her Bacon was saved to devote the remainder of his life to literary
compositions, which have greatly redeemed his name from obloquy.
We must regard the character of our Bacon as streaky, for the dark
is intermingled with the fair in the most wonderful manner. " Bacon
was undoubtedly rash, but he might have been rasher," says the
incorrigible Strype, whose name is continually suggestive of the
lashing he merited.

The Commons having been instrumental in bringing to light a
considerable quantity of corruption, seemed determined to continue
on the same scent, and every one who had a grievance was invited to
lay it at once before Parliament. The waste-paper baskets of the
House were of course soon overflowing with popular complaints, for
there is scarcely a man, woman, or child that cannot rake up a
grievance of some kind, upon the invitation of persons professing to
be able and willing to supply a remedy. James, fearful that his
prerogative would be intrenched upon, wrote a letter to the Speaker,
advising the Commons not to form themselves into an assembly of
gossips, to listen to all the tittle-tattle that an entire nation of
scandal-mongers would be ready to collect; but the House would
not be diverted from its honest purpose by the sneers or threats of
the sovereign. A good deal of polite and other letter-writing
ensued between the king and the Parliament, until the latter entered
on its Journals a protestation, claiming the freedom of speech and
the right of giving advice as the undoubted " inheritance of the
subjects of England."


James was furious at what had occurred, and ordering- the Journals
of the Commons to be brought to him, he contemptuously tore out
the page; and then, sending back the book, advised the House to
turn over a new leaf as soon as possible. " Tell your master," said
Coke, in a whisper that nobody heard, " tell him he will do well to
take a leaf out of our book, but not in the style in which this leaf
has been taken." Parliament was first prorogued, and then
dissolved by the king, who declared it would do no good as long as
it lasted, and Coke, who was charged with adding fuel to the
Parliamentary fire, was sent to the Tower with several others.


On the day of the dissolution James nearly met with his own
dissolution, for while taking a ride on a spirited horse, who had perhaps
a certain instinctive sympathy with the popular cause, he was thrown
into the New River. This was on the 6th of January, 1622, when the
water was frozen; and James had just been saying to himself, " I'm
glad I have made the plunge, and broken the ice with these
turbulent Commons," when he found himself plunging and breaking the
ice after another fashion. Fortunately his boots were buoyant—
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 195 -->
perhaps they had cork soles—and Sir Richard Young, seizing a
boat-hook, which he converted for the moment into a boot-hook,
drew the sovereign by the heels from what he afterwards declared
was decidedly not his proper element.


Buckingham, as we have already seen, was the sole successor to
Somerset in the office of royal favourite; but Charles, the Prince of  
  
  
  King James rescued from the New River.

Wales, had taken rather an aversion than otherwise to the person
whom his father patronised. The friends of the latter were generally
so disreputable, that his son could not go wrong in avoiding them;
but Buckingham beginning to look upon Charles as the better
speculation of the two, resolved on making himself as agreeable as
possible to the more faithful and therefore more promising branch of
royalty. The duke, being fond of scampish adventure, proposed a
plan better suited to be made the incident of a farce, than to be
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P225_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 196 -->
ranked as an event in history. He suggested that Charles and
himself should travel to Spain under the assumed names of Jack Smith
and Tom Smith, in order that the prince might introduce himself to
the Infanta of Spain, whom it had been proposed he should marry.
For such a wild-goose scheme to succeed, an Infanta of Spain must
have been much more accessible in those days than in ours; for
though Jack Smith and Tom Smith might find their way into a
public-house parlour, and make love to the landlord's daughter, they
would assuredly never be allowed to carry their gallantries into
any European palace, or even to obtain admittance into any
respectable private family. James, when the scheme was proposed to him,
discouraged it at first, but being taken by the scapegrace couple in
\"a jovial humour," which means when the trio happened to be
disgracefully drunk, the consent of the king was given to the
farcical enterprise.


Having arrived at Madrid, the two hopeful youths rode up on
mules to the door of Sir Thomas Digby, the British ambassador, and
sent in the names of John and Thomas Smith; but Digby, knowing
no less than half a hundred Smiths, declined seeing the " party"
unless a more special description was sent up to him. Without
waiting for further formality, Buckingham—alias Tom Smith—
walked with his portmanteau straight into the ambassador's presence,
after a series of scuffles on the staircase, and in the passages,
accompanied by shouts of " Keep back, fellow! " " You can't come up!"
and other exclamations that had prepared Digby to give Tom
Smith a reception by no means encouraging. When the ambassador
recognised his visitor, his manner completely changed, and his
politeness knew no bounds when in Jack Smith, who entered next,
Digby saw no less a person than the heir to the throne of England.


The incognito was of course at an end in an instant, and the next
day Buckingham and the prince were presented to the royal family
of Spain, though the farce of the disguise was still kept up to a
certain extent; and the Infanta was sent out in her father's carriage,
\"sitting in the boot," says Howell, " that Charles might get a sight
of her." The position of a young lady looking from the boot of a
carriage could not have been very becoming, and she does not seem
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 197 -->
to have made a particularly favourable impression on her intended
suitor. He nevertheless expressed his readiness to have another
look at her, and he played the part of lover at Buckingham's
instigation, for the purpose of getting a variety of presents from the young
lady's family.


Her brother Philip was anxious for the match, and did everything
to encourage it, by giving some valuable article to Charles whenever
he evinced anything like affection for the young Infanta. One clay
he pretended to be in a particularly tender mood, and at every piece
of gallantry he displayed Philip gave him something costly to take
away with him. By a series of smirks, leers, and pretty speeches, he
secured some original pictures by Titian and Correggio, but when he
rushed up to the Infanta with amorous playfulness, pinking her in the
side with his cane, and giving the Spanish version of " Whew, you
little baggage! " the Queen of Spain was so delighted that she
emptied her reticule, which was full of amber, into the pocket of the
Prince, while the word " Halves " was whispered in a sepulchral tone
into his ear by the crafty and avaricious. Buckingham.


When they had got all they could out of the Spanish royal
family, the English prince and his companion made up their minds
that the Infanta was a failure, and that they had better get home
with all possible celerity. Buckingham began treating Philip with
the most disrespectful familiarity, slapping him boisterously on the
back, alluding to him curtly, but not courteously, as Phil., and
otherwise offending the royal dignity. At length Prince Charles and his
companion called to take leave, when the former played his old part
of a devoted lover, beating in the crown of his hat, stamping on the
floor, and giving the numerous signs of devotion that a practice of
several weeks under a popular actor had made him completely
master of. He had no sooner turned his back upon Madrid, and
commenced moving towards home, than he made up his mind to cut
the matrimonial connection; and he announced his determination by
a messenger, who was instructed to say to Philip, that, for the good
of both parties, and decidedly for the happiness of one, the
abandonment of the marriage was much to be desired. Philip, upon whom
the Infanta was a drag he would have been glad to get off his hands,
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 198 -->
became angry at the tampering that had taken place with the young
lady's affections; but as these were no doubt pretty tough, the
damage was not material. A proxy had been left in the hands of
Digby, Earl of Bristol, the British Ambassador at Madrid, and the
royal family sent nearly every day, with their compliments, begging
to know when the proxy was to be acted upon; but finding at last,
that, notwithstanding the proxy, there was no approximation to a
satisfactory result, a most unpleasant feeling was created. Bristol,
who was a man of honour, felt very uncomfortable at the evasive
replies he was compelled to give, and was not sorry to return to
England; though he had, as he naturally observed, " not bargained
for the warrant which, in the most unwarrantable manner, awaited
his arrival, and sent him straight to the Tower." He was soon
afterwards released, but was not allowed by Buckingham, the favourite,
to approach the king, and a recommendation to Bristol to go to
Bath, or to retire to his country seat, was the only reply the
exambassador could obtain to his solicitations to be allowed to offer
explanations to his sovereign.


Charles had given the Infanta scarcely time to recover from the
jilting she had just undergone, when, with a cruel disregard of that
young person's feelings, he made up to Mademoiselle Henrietta of
France, and a marriage with the latter was speedily concluded.
The dowry, amounting to about,£100,000, was paid partly down,
but the nuptial ceremony was performed by proxy; and the English
government wrote over to say, that there was no hurry about
the bride, provided some of the cash was transmitted to England
as speedily as possible.


With some of the cash thus obtained, and with money squeezed
out of the people, an expensive engagement was formed with Count
Mansfeldt, an adventurer from the Low Countries, who undertook to
recover the Palatinate, if an English army of twelve thousand men
were placed under him. The troops were put at his disposal, and
embarked at Dover; but on reaching Calais the governor had no
orders to let them pass, and in consequence of the loss of the city in
Mary's time, the free list, of which the English had been in the
habit of taking advantage, was of course suspended. In vain did
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 199 -->
Mansfeldt inform the door-keeper that it was all right, and insist
that the name of Mansfeldt and party should have been left with the
authorities; for the man resolutely declared he had a duty to
perform, which prevented him from admitting the earl and his followers.
While they were waiting outside the bar of Calais, several of the
troops suffered severely from sea-sickness, and being obliged to go
round by the back way, they had become so attenuated, that instead
of being fit for marching into the Palatinate, they were much better
adapted for marching into Guy's Hospital.


The failure of this expedition was the last event of importance in
the reign of James, who was fast sinking under gout and tertian
ague, produced by a long indulgence in rums, gins, brandies, and
other compounds. He died, at the age of fifty-nine, on the 27th
of March, 1625, having reigned upwards of two-and-twenty years,
during which he showed himself fully deserving of the title bestowed
on him by Sully, who said of James I. that he was the " wisest fool
in Europe." He was learned, it is true, but his acquirements, such
as they were, became a bore, from his disagreeable habit of thrusting
them at most inappropriate times upon all who approached him.
He was weak, mean, and pusillanimous, while his excessive vanity
caused him to select for his companions those pitiful sycophants who
would affect admiration for those miserable qualities, which, had he
cultivated the friendship of honest and intelligent men, he might
have been eventually broken of. He lost, and indeed he did not
desire the society of his children, because they could not
sympathise with those littlenesses of character which, the older they grew,
their judgment caused them more and more to despise and deplore
in their unfortunate parent.


Happily only two out of seven survived to endure that alienation
which must have been painful while it would have been unavoidable:
and they were thus spared the humiliation of seeing a father vain,
selfish, and unrepentant to the last, while their deaths in rapid
succession gave him, happily, no uneasiness. For his eldest son he
had, as we have already seen, prohibited the wearing of mourning,
thus giving a proof of combined malice and stupidity, since his insults
to the dead were of course as impotent as they were wicked and
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 200 -->
infamous. He was suspicious in the extreme, and always fancied he
was going to be done or done for. To guard against the latter
contingency he wore a quilted doublet that was proof against a stiletto,
and under the apprehension of being taken advantage of, he
obstinately excluded every one from his confidence. The result was that
he never had a friend, through his constant dread of an imaginary
enemy. It has been said of him by one of his historians, that he
was fond of laughing at his own conceits; but the wretch who can
even smile at a joke of his own must be such a libel upon human
nature, that not even Hume-an(d) Smollett (ha! ha! mark the
pun) shall make us believe that an individual so abject could ever
have existed.


Though the sovereign himself was not calculated to inspire
respect, there were many events in his reign which rendered it useful
if not glorious. Sir Hugh Middleton commenced at Amwell that
now venerable New River, by dabbling in which he swamped
himself and secured a stream of health and prosperity to those who
came after him. The immortal Hicks finished his memorable Hall;
Lord Napier invented logarithms, to the extreme disgust of the
school-boys of every generation; and Dr. Harvey made the
magnificent discovery that the blood is a periodical enjoying the most
unlimited circulation. Two Dutch navigators contrived to double Cape
Horn; which the reader must not imagine was twice its present
size before that operation was performed, for Cape Horn, like any
other cape, is not larger when doubled. Bill Baffin, an Englishman
(you all know Bill Baffin) discovered Baffin's Bay in the year 1616,
and a patent for the fire engine, granted two years afterwards, has
been stated as a proof that steam power was first known in England
in 1618, though upon inquiry we are inclined to think there was more
of smoke than steam in the invention spoken of.


The wealth and extravagance of the nobles, among whom
corruption and bribery were practised " wholesale, retail, and for
exportation," may be imagined from the statement, that on the
marriage of the French king, the horse of the English ambassador wore
silver shoes so loosely fastened on, that they fell off, and were
instantly replaced, for distribution among the populace. We can
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 201 -->
scarcely believe that any English horse could have walked in these
silver shoes or slippers in the time of James, however skilfully they
could have substituted sliding for walking, since the Wood Demon,
coming to London, caused the introduction of wooden pavements.


The luxury and display that stand prominently forward among
the characteristics of the period, were discountenanced by James
when seen in others, though he would have spared nothing for the
selfish gratification of his own extravagance. Bacon, whose
tendency to flattery justifies the popular analogy between butter and
bacon, remarked of the king that he would recommend the country
gentlemen to remain at their seats, by saying to them, " In London
you are like ships in a sea, which show like nothing; but in
your country villages you are like ships in a river, which look
like great things." This, after all, was a funny idea, but a bad
argument; for a ship in a river, like a storm in a puddle, is
somewhat out of its element. Many would prefer being wrecked in the
ocean of a busy but tempestuous life, to remaining aground in the
dismal swamp of rural obscurity. The thing to be desired, is the
art of keeping a steady course, and steering in the right direction;
but it is mere pusillanimity to accept a recommendation to shirk
the voyage.


Among the inventions of the reign of James, we must not omit to
mention the sedan, a contrivance of the lazy and luxurious
Buckingham. On its first appearance in public, the mob hooted the machine
as it passed, declaring that their fellow-creatures should not do the
service of beasts; but the " fellow-creatures," being paid for and
liking the job, were the first to beat off their friends, the people.
The friends of humanity were however not content till they had
broken in the top and knocked out the bottom of the machine)
leaving Buckingham to walk home in a most uncomfortable case,
with his head peering out at the top, and his feet appearing at the
bottom, of his novel equipage.


The literary characters who flourished in the reign of James were
very numerous; and we must, of course, place at the head of them
our old acquaintance the " Swan of Avon," as some goose has  
  
  
  VOL. II. D P
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 202 -->
most irreverently christened him. Shakspeare adorned the time
of James by dying in it, as, by living in it, he shed a lustre on
that of Elizabeth.


One of our predecessors* in the gigantic task we have
undertaken—and by the way, it is said that Mr. Macaulay, fired by our
shining example, is preparing himself to follow it by a retirement
from public life—one of our predecessors, we repeat, has thrown cold
water upon the warm admiration which is felt for Shakspeare to this
day, and which at this very moment is urging the whole nation to
buy his house at Stratford, though the town was burnt f down at
about the time when the poet lived in it. Our own enthusiasm,
which was great at first for the possession of this relic, has, we
confess, a little abated since our research put us in possession of the
unpleasant fact, that the bard must have been burnt out,
notwithstanding the assurance of the auctioneer, who acts, of course, on
what he considers the best policy. Whatever we may think of the
house the poet left or did not leave behind him, the houses he still
draws by the magic of his genius are sufficient to refute the
argument of the hypercritical Hume, that Shakspeare appeared greater
than he really was, because he happened to be irregular. We are
not aware that irregularity and grandeur must necessarily seem to
be combined, and indeed, irregularity in payment, which
considerably aggrandises an account, is the only instance we can call
to mind in which we see some ground for our fellow-historian's
strange hypothesis.


Fletcher, the dramatist, and his partner Beaumont, belonged to
the reign of James; but when the latter died, in 1616, the firm was
broken up; and as each had been nothing by himself, Fletcher fell
into wretched insignificance. His name had only been known in
connection with that of Beaumont, and if he attempted to play the
lion afterwards at an evening party, a cool enquiry of "Fletcher!
Fletcher! who's Fletcher ?" was the. only sensation the
announcement of his name elicited. Some say he died of the plague in 1625,  
  
  
  * Hume.


+ Stratford-upon-Avon was all destroyed by fire in September, 1614, two years
before Shakspeare's death.
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 203 -->
but it is more probable that the plaguy indifference shown towards
him everywhere, after he lost poor Beaumont, was in reality the
death of him.


Honest Jack Stowe, the antiquarian, ought not to be overlooked,
though time has long since stowed away his works among the
lumber of our libraries. His Survey of London was his greatest
literary labour, and he was preparing a new edition in 1605, when
he was obliged to " Stow it" by an attack of illness that unhappily
proved fatal.


Donne, the poet, can hardly be mentioned among the literary
dons of the age; but Bacon is a luminary that must not be snuffed
out in a single sentence. It has been said that his wit was
farfetched, but a thing is certainly not the less valuable for having been
brought from a long way off; for if it were so, the diamond would
lose much of its value in the London market. If Bacon's wit was
far-fetched, it was not only worth the carriage, but it has been found
sufficiently valuable to warrant its being forwarded on from
generation to generation; and it will, we suspect, find its way to a still
remote posterity, before it arrives at the terminus of its journey.


James himself was but a contemptible writer, and would have
been scarcely worth his five pounds a week in these days, as the
London correspondent of a country newspaper. His imagination
would not have been vigorous enough to supply him with the " latest
intelligence," which must always be in type at least two days before
the date on which the facts it professes to impart are stated to have
happened. As an industrious chronicler of early gooseberries, new
carrots, gigantic cabbages, irruptions of lady-birds, and showers of
frogs, he would have been useful in his way, or he might have
undertaken that branch of periodical literature which embraces the
interesting recollections—or non-recollections rather—of the oldest
inhabitant.

  Parliament.  
  
  
  ON the afternoon
of Monday, March
the 28th, 1625, Charles I.
was proclaimed at
Charing Cross, amid a
tremendous shower of rain
and hail, so that the
commencement of his
reign was hailed in a
somewhat disagreeable
manner. His first care
was to turn out the fools
and buffoons that his
father had kept at Court,
or rather, as
Buckingham called it, to get rid
of the comic and
pantomimic company which
had been established in
the palace. He next
determined to send over  
  
  
  Petitioning for a Loan.

for his new bride, who appeared to have been forgotten in the
hurry of business, and who was waiting at Paris, "to be left till
called for." Buckingham was despatched to take charge of the
precious cargo; but his behaviour at the French Court was so
disreputable that he received some very broad hints as to the
propriety of his speedy return to England. He made love to the
young Queen Anne of Austria, and flirted with every female
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P234_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 205 -->
member of the royal family, to the extreme disgust of Cardinal
Richelieu, who told him, plainly, that such conduct could not be
permitted, at any price.


Buckingham took his departure, with the young Henrietta, on
the 23rd of May; but there must have been pretty goings on, or
dreadful standings still, during the journey, for it was the 27th of
June before they arrived at Dover. Charles, who had naturally
begun to wonder what had become of his minister and his bride, set
off to meet them, and having slept at Canterbury on the 27th of
June, he reached Dover on the 28th, and found his intended, who
had " put up " at the Castle.


The first interview was very dramatic, for Charles extended both
his arms, and Henrietta, taking a hop, a skip, and a jump, tumbled
gracefully into them. Finding her a little taller than he expected,
he looked at her feet, when the young princess coquettishly pulled
off her shoe, to prove that there was no imposition practised,
and that it was impossible there could be any deception through
the medium of high heels, for she had, in reality, a sole above
it. The newly married couple started for Canterbury at once, and
making another day of it to Rochester, they came via Gravesend
to London, where they arrived in the midst of one of those pelting
showers which have been graphically compared to a melee of cats,
dogs, and pitchforks.


Charles, being in want of money, had assembled a Parliament,
which opened for business on the 18th of June, and he at once asked
for some supplies; but as he stammered in his speech, there was a
sort of hesitation in his demand, which some took for modesty.
With real, or affected delicacy, he declined mentioning any specific
sum, but requested his faithful Commons to give what they pleased,
and they were thus placed in the embarrassing position of a
gentleman, who, on asking " what's to pay ? " finds it left to that dreadfully
sliding-scale, his " own generosity." This dishonest manœuvre, for
such it usually is, succeeds frequently in extracting twice the proper
amount from the pockets of him whose liberality is thus artfully
invoked; but the Commons, being apparently " up to the dodge,"
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 206 -->
voted Charles £112,000, to meet liabilities to the tune of some
£700,000 per annum, for the war, to say nothing of his father's
debts and other contingencies. Pocketing this miserably inadequate
contribution, he adjourned the Parliament, on account of the Plague,
and having met it again at Oxford, in August of the same year, he
told the Commons, plainly, that he " must have cash," for he was
being dunned by the King of Denmark, who held his promissory
note, and that his private creditors would allow him no peace in his
own palace.


He protested solemnly that he had not the means of paying his
way for the subsistence of himself and his family, and, throwing a
quantity of tradesmen's accounts, unsettled, before the Speaker's
chair, asked, imploringly, if those were the sort of bills that could be
got rid of by ordering them to be read that day six months, or by
their being suffered to lie on the table ? The Commons shook their
heads, expressed their regret, buttoned up their pockets, and declared
they could do nothing. The matter now became serious, for Charles
had changed his butcher already three or four times, and was having
his bread of nearly the last of a confiding batch of bakers. "
Something must be done," he said, with much solemnity, to himself,
and he wrote off a polite note to the Corporations of Salisbury
and Southampton, requesting the loan of £3000, which was loyally
granted him. Angry at being baffled and left insolvent by his
Parliament, he declared that he would, at least, prove himself
solvent in one respect, by dissolving the Parliament who had so
rudely resisted his demands.


Finding that he had got nothing by begging, and very little by
borrowing, he was thrown upon the expedient of stealing, as a last
resort. With the money lent him by some of his subjects he resolved
on fitting out a fleet, under Cecil, to attack some Spanish ships,
which he understood were lying at Cadiz, with some valuable cargoes
on board. He reached the bay, and being kept at bay by the
enemy, for a short time, he at last landed, very silently, the leaders
exclaiming '■'Piano, Piano" and took a fort. The troops, finding a
quantity of wine in the garrison, partook so freely of it that they lost
all their ammunition, and spoiled several pounds of best canister, by
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 207 -->
making too free with the juice of the grape. Cecil, finding that the
longer they remained the more intoxicated they got, resolved on
reshipping as many as could be got to stand upon their legs, and to
return to England. The British sailors were, however, in those
days, such delicate creatures that half of them died of sea-sickness,
and a very few of them returned home alive.


Charles, having been foiled in his last hope of recruiting his
exhausted resources by plunder, resolved to try another Parliament,
and a new one was manufactured with a view to give every chance
to the experiment. He endeavoured to weaken the opposition by
putting several of its members into offices which would prevent them
from sitting in the House of Commons; but, this artful manœuvre
having been seen through, only served to put the people more on
their guard.


The new Parliament was in its principles the fae simile of its
predecessor, and on the 6th of February 1626, voted to Charles just
about one-tenth of what he really wanted, and one-twentieth of what
he asked. Notwithstanding the smallness of the subsidy, he took it,
and resolved to pay his creditors something on account, as far as
the money would go, and trust to the future to enable him to make
up the deficiency. Having shown a pretty resolute disposition in
dealing with the king, it is not surprising that the Commons
should at length have determined to take a turn at the minister.
Buckingham had long been very obnoxious, and one Dr. Turner—
remarkable for his straight-forward conduct, and his determination
not to turn—moved a question, " Whether Common Report was
a good ground of proceeding r" Though Common Report has
generally been accounted a common story-teller, she had been
tolerably right about the Duke of Buckingham, and the
resolution to proceed against him on the faith of Common Report was
at once approved.


On the 8th of May, a still more resolute step was taken with
reference to the " favourite," as this generally detested person was
absurdly called, by articles of impeachment being preferred against
him. The duke and his master seemed to treat the matter rather as
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 208 -->
a joke, and Charles even went down to the House of Lords to speak
in favour of Buckingham. These proceedings were so clearly
unconstitutional and irregular, that if the British Lion had taken to
roaring, and only roared out in time, he might have saved many of
the disagreeable consequences that unhappily followed. Considering
how very intrusive this animal has sometimes been on occasions
when he really was not wanted, it is lamentable to think that " the
squeak in time," which might have saved nine times nine hundred
and ninety-nine, was not forthcoming at the exact moment when its
value would have been extreme.


Notwithstanding the impeachment of Buckingham, he was still
loaded with fresh honours, and he became Chancellor of the
University of Cambridge, at which the Commons vainly expressed their
disgust. They nevertheless continued boldly enough remonstrating
against this, and that, and the other, until the king regularly shut
them up by a dissolution, without their having passed a single Act.


Charles, sympathising with Nature in an utter abhorrence of a
vacuum, which he found in the royal treasury, devoted all his
energies to filling it. " Must have cash," was the motto adopted by
his Majesty; who was not particular whether he begged, borrowed,
or stole, so that he succeeded in replenishing his pockets. He
looked up every outstanding liability, and routed out a lot of
recusants who had fallen into arrear with their penalties. He borrowed
money from the nobility—if it can be called borrowing to go up to a
person, exclaiming, " Lend me your money," and at the same time
take it forcibly away from him. But the most tremendous swindle
of all was the demand of ship-money; a tax he laid upon all
seaports, under the pretence of their contributing a certain number of
ships to the defence of the country. He, of course, pocketed the
proceeds without supplying the ships, so that if the country had
been attacked, there would not have been a sail to resist the
assailants. Charles and his favourite, Buckingham, declared,
with disreputable frivolity, that the ship money was appropriately
applied; for it was, in fact, floating capital, and helped to keep
them above water just as much as if it had been devoted to the
purchase of a navy.
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 209 -->

Something having been said during the sitting of Parliament
about a subsidy, which had never been granted, Charles thought he
might as well collect it at any rate, though the Commons had
declined voting it. Promises were held out that it should all be
paid back out of the next supplies, or, in fact, that though the king
helped himself from the right-hand pockets of his subjects, he would  
  
  
  His Gracious Majesty Charles I. borrowing money

return the money out of their left-hand pockets—some day or another.
A great many of the people, who objected to this remote reversionary
interest, were thrown into prison, or sent to serve in the navy, where
they became British Tars in spite of themselves, and some of them
having received a classical education, introduced, no doubt, the
College Hornpipe into the fleet as an elegant and scholarly pastime.  
  
  
  Even the church was made the medium of extortion, for the

<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 210 -->
popular preachers recommended from their pulpits the propriety of
cashing up to any extent that the sovereign might require. By way
of economising at home, Charles went one afternoon to the queen's
apartments and dismissed every one of her tribe of French servants,
who were dancing and curvetting in the presence of their mistress.
This ballet of private life was summarily brought to a close by a
general chassez of the whole crew, who had been dancing attendance
on her Majesty since her marriage, and she was so enraged at their
dismissal that she broke the windows with her fist, which shows the
panes she was at to mark her displeasure. The French women
howled very piteously, so that, between their lamentations in broken
English, and the queen's expostulations in broken glass, the hubbub
was truly terrible.


These disturbances fomented the ill feeling between France
and England, which Buckingham desired to increase, and he
actually had the excessive vanity to put himself at the head of a
fleet, which sailed to Rochelle, where he "carried himself nobly,"
to use the words of the king, but where, in fact, he carried
himself off as speedily as his legs would allow, for he ran away after
having made a desperate failure. Charles was now, once more,
as completely cleaned out as a young scamp in a farce, who arrives
"without sixpence in his pocket," just like " love among the roses; "
and Buckingham was the roguish valet who is usually in attendance
on the eccentric light comedian under the circumstances alluded to.
The worthy couple discussed the best method of raising the wind,
and it was agreed that there was nothing left but to try it on
again with a Parliament. "We shall have writs out against
ourselves," said Charles, "if we do not get the writs out for
summoning the Commons."


They met on the 17th of March, 1628, and several of the most
determined opponents to ship-money were found in the new
House, which included Bradshaw, the brewer, who was ready to
brew the storm of revolution, as well as Maurice, a grocer, who
suited the times to a T with his liberal sentiments. The king made
a haughty speech, but the Parliament determined to proceed with
address, and, upon the grand piscatorial principle of throwing a
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 211 -->
sprat to catch a herring, five subsidies were hinted at for the
purpose of securing concessions of the utmost value to English
liberty. The Petition of Right was accordingly drawn up, which
declared the illegality of collecting money except by the authority
of Parliament. It next referred to our old friend, your old friend,
and everybody else's old friend, Magna Charta, or Carter, as some
people call it—perhaps because a broad-wheeled waggon has been
frequently driven through it—and this document was recited to prove
that people could not be imprisoned without cause; though,
unfortunately for them, they had been imprisoned very frequently, in
spite of the arrangement that made such a circumstance quite
impossible. The Petition of Right next alluded to the billeting
of soldiers on private houses, which had grown into such an abuse,
that scarcely a family could sit down to tea without half-a-dozen
troopers dropping in during the meal, and pocketing the spoons,
cribbing the cups, or saucily appropriating the saucers, when the
entertainment was concluded.


The Bill of Rights having been drawn by the Commons, and
endorsed by the Lords, was offered to Charles for his acceptance.
Without either rejecting it or adopting it, he wrote under the
petition a few vague generalities, which meant nothing at all, and
the Commons retiring to their Chamber, vented their indignation in
a very spirited manner. Sir Robert Phillips uttered several severe
Philippics against the sovereign; Sir D. Digges followed, with some
tremendous digs at the throne, declaring it was quite infra dig.
for the Commons to sit still and do nothing; while Mr. Kurton,
or, as that miscreant Strype calls him, Curtain,* threw off the
veil; and even old Coke gave symptoms of having caught the
revolutionary flame.


Selden, whose table-talk is much more amusing than his talk
at the table of the House of Commons, proposed a strong declaration
under four heads, and was in the midst of a powerful harangue,


* We regret to say, that the motive of Strype in calling this person Curtain, instead
of Kurton, is too obvious. A feu de nwt is at the bottom of this baseness. We forbear
from saying more.
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 212 -->
when Finch, the Speaker, who had got the name of Chaff-Finch,
from the badinage in which he indulged, ran breathless into the
House with a message from the king, recommending, as well as his
puffing and blowing would permit, an adjournment until the next
morning. Notwithstanding the valour that had been displayed in
words, the Commons had not yet learned how to act with courage,

and they quietly adjourned at the suggestion of the sovereign.
The next day, however, they met again, and having plucked up all
their pluck, they continued to demand an explicit answer to the
Petition of Right, to which the assent of Charles was, one fine
afternoon in June, 1628, somewhat unexpectedly given.
Buckingham, who could never keep quiet, resolved to make another
warlike venture at Rochelle, and had got as far as Portsmouth,
where, on the 23rd of August, says Howell, "he got out of bed
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P242_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 213 -->
in good-humour, and cut a caper or two" in his nightcap and
dressing-gown.


These capers were soon destined to be cut very short, for as the
Duke was passing to his carriage in the course of the day, he
received a stab from somebody in a crowd of gesticulating
Frenchmen, who were all suspected of being the assassins, and instead of
being taken into custody were, oddly enough, kicked down stairs.
Buckingham was as dead as the British and Foreign Institute, when
a number of captains and gentlemen rushed into the kitchen of the
house, exclaiming—"Where is the villain?" " Oil est le boucher ?"
Upon this a gentleman of the name of Felton, who had been
screening himself in the meat-screen, stood forth, and struck an attitude,
vociferating "Here I am." He then handed over his hat, in the
crown of which he had stitched the full and true particulars
of his own crime, which he requested might be read out, while he
did the appropriate pantomime to the confession in the centre of
a group of listeners. Felton gloried in the act he had committed,
and when put upon his trial there was a good deal of badinage
between himself and Judge Jones, whom the prisoner politely
thanked for the announcement that he was to be hanged until he
was dead, at Tyburn.


The king was greatly affected on hearing of Buckingham's death,
and, according to the accounts of the period, his Majesty rolled
himself about on his bed in an agony of tears, until nothing but a wet
blanket seemed to hang over all his prospects. He nevertheless
continued his attention to business, but he never had another
favourite like Buckingham, whom his Majesty used to apostrophise
familiarly as "my Buck," and hence that term of amiability no
doubt has its origin. He admitted Laud to be in many respects
laudable; and of Wentworth he acknowledged the worth, while Noy,
whose maxims contain the maximum of wisdom, was so far
appreciated, as to get the place of Attorney-General.


On the 30th of January, 1629, the Parliament met once more,
and Charles, turning out both his pockets, urged the necessity of
supplies. He declared that as to his balance at his bankers, it had
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 214 -->
become like "linked sweetness," for it had been "long drawn out," and
the public treasury had been swept up several times, in the hope of
finding an odd coin or two; but there was not a shilling to be found,
and Charles was running up bills in all directions with his
tradespeople. The Commons, instead of giving him the money to pay his
debts, brought against him all their own old scores, and there were  
  
  
  The Member for Huntingdon

several stormy discussions, the storminess of which may be accounted
for by the long-windedness of many of the orators.


Among those who took part in these debates, was a
clownishlooking person of about thirty years of age, with a slovenly coat, and
a hat so bad that Strype hints it was perhaps without a crown, to
mark the republican objection to crowns which was entertained by
the owner. This individual was Mr. Oliver Cromwell, the new
member for Huntingdon, who brewed beer and political storms,
until the country itself became Cromwell's entire, the Crown his
butt, and the Constitution his mash-tub.  
  
  
  Charles, finding the Parliament in a very unaccommodating
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P244_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 215 -->
humour, desired Sir John Finch, the Speaker, to adjourn the House,
but the House refused to be adjourned, and when he was about to
leave the chair, he found himself suddenly knocked back into it,
with his arms pinioned, which rendered him incapable of putting
any motion whatever, for he was quite motionless. A few privy
councillors, rushing in, endeavoured to release him, but the opposite
party bound him again to the chair, and the trial of strength
between the two factions ended in a tie—as far as poor Finch was
concerned—for he remained fastened in the seat of dignity.


At length the Speaker, who could not dissolve the House, began
dissolving himself in tears, and the king who had been waiting for him
to come and tell the news, was so impatient, that messengers were
despatched to know what had become of him. Hearing that Finch
was caged, or in other words locked in, the king could only leave
the poor bird to his fate; but he despatched a messenger to tell the
sergeant to slip out of the House quietly with his mace, which would
dissolve the sitting. The sergeant may perhaps have forgotten the
right cue, but he had got the right mace, and had walked nearly to
the door, when he was stopped and pushed back, the key of the
House taken from him and placed in the hands of one of the members,
who promised to keep tight hold of it.


Charles, hearing that the door was bolted, went down, determined
to force it open; but happily, he found the Commons had bolted
instead of the door, or at least, they were on the point of doing so. The
king, nevertheless, ordered several of the ringleaders to be arrested,
and he intimated pretty plainly to the Commons that he would not
trouble them again for a very considerable period. He had, in fact,
resolved to take all matters of government entirely into his own
hands; and though Magna Charta, with a few other trifles of the
kind, stood in his way, he did not scruple to trample on rights
and liberties, which he knew were being continually renewed, as
occasion required.


On the ioth of March, 1629, the day to which the Commons had
adjourned themselves, Charles came down to the House of Lords
with the proclamation of dissolution in his pocket. His Majesty
began by saying, that this was " really a very unpleasant business,"
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 216 -->
that " he had no fault to find with the Lords," but " there were some
vipers among the Commons; " whom, according to the unhappy
Strype, he expressed his determination of " viping out "—observe
the paltry evasion of the W for the sake of the pun—" with the
utmost energy." Thus, by flattering the Lords and threatening the
Commons, or, to continue the language of Strype, "soaping the
Upper House, and lathering the Lower," did Charles dissolve his
Parliament.


Several members had already been placed in custody, among
whom were Eliot, Holies, and Selden, the last of whom was such
an inveterate table-talker, that his tongue was always getting him
into scrapes of the most serious character. An information was
exhibited against them in the Star-Chamber, but they were
subsequently offered their release, on promising to be of good behaviour,
which they refused to do, for they felt they would have been good
for nothing had they entered into such a disgraceful compact. Eliot
died in prison, and the rest were adjudged to be detained during the
pleasure of the king, and as he took great pleasure in persecuting
his refractory Commons, there was every chance that their " durance
vile " would be unpleasantly durable.


The 29th of May, 1630, was signalised by the birth of Prince
Charles, and it is said that a bright star shone in the east at
midday, which some have considered ominous. To us, the appearance
of the star by daylight, on the birth of this dissolute scapegrace,
denotes nothing more than a propensity for not going home till
morning, or till daylight did appear. About the same time that
severities were being practised on the Commons, one Richard
Chambers refused to pay more than legal duty on a bale of silk, and the
Custom-house officers going at him rather fiercely, he declared that
\"merchants were more screwed in England than they were in
Turkey." His audience hearing him use the word "screwed," at once
nailed him to the expression, and he was fined£2000 for the lapsus
linguæ he had fallen into.


Unhappily, political martyrdom was not, in those days, so
good a trade as it has subsequently become, and poor Chambers
had neither a subscription opened to pay his fine, nor a testimonial
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 217 -->
to reimburse him for the expense of resistance. A struggle for
principle was then a struggle indeed, and not an eligible medium
for advertisements. A Chambers of the present day would have
made his principles pay him an enormous per centage, and
would have made a handsome fortune for himself by what he
would have termed his exertions for the happiness and liberty
of the people. Poor Chambers, however—the real martyr of 1630—
died in a prison at last, after waiting for redress from the Long
Parliament, which was a little too long in making reparation to the
victim of oppression.


Charles had apparently made up his mind to get on as well as he
could without any parliament at all, and having bribed some of the
cleverest fellows in the kingdom, he thought that as one fool
proverbially makes many, one or two knaves would also be found to
fructify. Among the shameless apostates of that day were of course
many who had been mouthing most energetically on the popular
side; and Wentworth, who had been originally one of the very
noisiest of the people's friends, became the meanest and most
inveterate of the people's enemies. Having brawled for some years
against aristocracy, his purpose at length peeped out in his
acceptance of a peerage for himself, and the man who had been continually
bullying the Court, became its fawning favourite. Digges, who had
been, as we have already intimated, digging away most energetically
at the constituted authorities, accepted the post of Master of the
Rolls, for he had, as he said, made the discovery on which side his
bread was buttered.


It would be tedious to the reader, and difficult to ourselves, to
give a catalogue of the exactions and impositions which were
practised by Charles between the years 1629, when the Parliament was
dissolved, and 1640, the year marked by the assembly of a new one.
He revived, among other cruelties, the old practice of making
Knights of all persons possessing forty pounds a year, and either
charging ruinous fees for imposing the so-called honour, or imposing
a heavy fine for declining it. Knighthood became such a fearful
drug in the market of dignities, that it is not surprising it should
even up to this day have failed to recover its position. The cry of  
  
  
  VOL. II. F V
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 218 -->
\"Dilly, dilly," was never more ferociously addressed to the ducks
who were invited to " come and be killed," than was the command
to " come and be knighted," enforced against the unwilling victims,
who were selected either to pay the penalty for declining, or the fees
on receiving this unenviable distinction.


While guilty of wholesale persecution, Charles did not, however,
neglect the retail branch, and a Puritan preacher named Leighton—
a blind fanatic, but, notwithstanding his blindness, no relation we
believe to Leighton Buzzard—was exposed to the utmost cruelty for
writing some ad eaptandum trash against the Queen and the Bishops;
a bombastic little work, which neither repaid perusal, nor repaid the
printer who brought it forward. Poor Leighton was fined for his
coarseness, and flogged for his flagellation of the authorities, besides
being compelled to undergo a variety of other barbarisms, the
narration of which we would have attempted, but we found our very ink
turning pale at the bare prospect of our doing so. The Puritans
now began to emigrate in great numbers to America, and they no
doubt laid the foundation of that drawl which has ever since
distinguished the tone of the model republicans.


We now arrive at the tragical story of poor Mr. William Prynne,
a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, who, in the utter absence of briefs,
finding himself at a dead stand-still for want of a motion, had started
a trumpery little work with one Sparkes, a publisher. The volume
had the unattractive title of " Plistrio APastric, the Players' Scourge,
or Actors' Tragedie," in which he made an attempt to write down
the stage in particular, and all amusements in general. He
denounced all who went to the play as irredeemably lost, and he
neither exempted the free list, the half-price, or those who went in
with the orders of the Press, from the anathema, which he hurled
indiscriminately against the " brilliant and crowded audiences "
nightly honouring such-and-such an establishment with a succession
of overflows.


The queen not only patronised the drama, but sometimes
appeared herself as a distinguished amateur, and the whole of Prynne's
book was taken to apply to her, though she was not even
mentioned in any part of it. Poor Prynne was declared to be a wolf
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 219 -->
in sheep's clothing, and, considering that he was a barrister who
had turned author, the alleged mixture of wolfishness and
sheepishness may be fairly attributed to his character. He was found guilty,
of course, and upon sentence being passed, the Chief Justice
expressed his regret that a gentleman, who had handed in on two or
three occasions a compute, and was a promising junior of twenty
years' standing—without ever being on his legs—should have brought
himself into such an unpleasant predicament.


He was condemned to be degraded from the profession, or in fact
to be dishonoured; to pay a fine of five thousand pounds, which was
by no means feasible, when we consider his fees, and to be kept
from the use of pen, ink, and paper, which was perhaps the most
humane part of the sentence, for he was thus prevented from
proceeding with his wretched trade of authorship. The poor fellow,
however, contrived to write humorous articles on the soles of his
boots; and " Prynne on the Understanding," though it was rubbed
out as mere rubbish by the man who cleaned his boots, might have
taken its place by the side of many more lofty productions of the
period. His sentence was exceedingly cruel, and comprised "
branding on the forehead," as if his enemies would have it believed "there
was nothing inside to hurt," while his nose' was savagely maltreated,
to prevent its being again poked into that which did not concern its
owner. His ears were cropped under the pretext of their being a
great deal too long, and indeed Prynne was so altered, as a
punishment for rushing into print, that his own clerk would not have
known him again in the abridged edition which the Government
reduced him to.


We have now to treat of the great civil war; but the magnitude
of the subject requires us to take breath, which we cannot do, unless
we break off and begin a fresh chapter.

books " whatever construction would be most favourable to the views
of his master.


The ingenious Noy took care to discover that the supplying of
ship-money by sea-ports was a custom as old as the hills, and
giving a large interpretation to the word hills, he assumed that
land as well as water should supply ships, and that inland places as
well as those on the coast were consequently liable to the impost.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P250_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 221 -->
He argued that almost every town, however far from the shore, had
marine interests, for there was always a dealer in marine stores, and
in fact he urged that a town being unable to float a ship, might
nevertheless be made to build, or at least to pay for one.


In the midst of these ingenious theories, and perplexing points of
law, Noy died, which is no matter of astonishment to us, for the idea
of looking up such a subject as ship-money, and having "case for
opinion " continually on his desk, is sufficiently formidable to
reconcile with it the decease of the barrister to whom the business had
been confided. London was selected as the first place on which the
demand for ship-money was made, and an attempt to excite the
fears of the citizens, by getting up a cry very like that of " Old
Bogie " was resorted to.


A proclamation was issued declaring that a set of " thieves,
pirates, robbers of the sea, and Turks" were expected by an early
boat, though a sharp look-out along the offing at Gravesend and
Richmond, through one of which the pirates must pass, would have
convinced the greenest of the green, that a corsair was not likely to
be eating his whitebait at Blackwall, nor was England in danger of
invasion by a horde of ruffians coming up from the other side of the
world at the Chelsea end of the metropolis. Several ships were
ordered, but the citizens would have been quite at sea had they
attempted to supply a ship, and a composition in money was demanded
as an easier method of satisfying the wants of the government.


Considerable resistance was made to this gigantic swindle, and
the celebrated John Hampden immortalised himself by the part he
took in the struggle. This true patriot had consulted his legal
advisers on the subject of ship-money, and hearing from them
that it could not be justly claimed, he determined that he would
resist the impost at any sacrifice. The matter came on for argument
upon demurrer, in the Court of Exchequer, on the 6th of November,
1637, and lasted till December the 18th, when their lordships were
unable to agree in their judgment.


The majority, however, ultimately decided against Hampden, but
two of the judges continuing to differ from the rest, it was felt
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 222 -->
that the imposition was seen through, and that the public would
have the sanction of at least some of the legal dignitaries for resisting
it. Wentworth would have whipped Hampden like poor Prynne,
but not all the black rods, white rods, and rods in pickle the Court
could muster, would have been sufficient for the flagellation of so
great a character.


The dissatisfaction of the people, and the unconstitutional
practices of the king, were not confined to England, for Scotland,
after having been taken—or rather having been merged in the
English monarchy—was destined to be well shaken by political
convulsions. The proximate cause of the dissatisfaction of the Scotch,
who are not a remarkably excitable race unless their pockets are
threatened, was the introduction of the English service into their
churches; and when the Dean of Edinburgh began to read it on
Sunday, the 23rd of July, 1637, he was assailed with shouts of the
most indecorous character. The populace clapped with their hands,
kicked with their heels, and bellowed with their lungs, till the Bishop
of Edinburgh, who had ascended the pulpit to entreat that order
might be preserved, was compelled to bob down his head to avoid a
three-legged-stool, that was thrown with savage force by one of the
assembled multitude.


The Scotch congregation continued to evince their zeal for their
religion by throwing sticks, stones, and dirt (of which they had a
good deal always on their hands) at the unprotected prelate, and
cries of " stone him," "at him again," "give it him," " throw him
over," " turn him out," resounded through the sacred edifice. The
religious ruffians kept up their ferocity without intermission wherever
the new service was commenced, and thus, though they might
easily have satisfied their consciences by abstaining from attendance
at the churches where innovation had been introduced, they
preferred to intimidate and brutally attack the inoffensive ministers.
This was another of the innumerable instances history has to record
of the name of religion being desecrated by its being applied to acts
utterly at variance with every religious principle.  
  
  
  Charles, who in this instance evinced a keen perception of Scotch
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 223 -->
character, resolved to punish the people of Edinburgh in a manner
they would be sure to feel; and by threatening to remove the council
of government from that city to Linlithgow, he touched them in
what is the Scotchman's tenderest point—his pocket. Whether it

was from fear of a general stoppage to business, and the consequent
loss of its profits, or from some more exalted cause, the Scotch
desisted from physical violence, and took a great moral resolution,
which is in every way respectable.  
  
  
  A document, called the Covenant, was drawn up, and its
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P253_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 224 -->
sentiments were put forth with the eloquence of enthusiasm from the
home of John O'Groat—by-the-bye, who was this Jack Fourpence,
Esq., of whom we have heard so much ?—to the hills of Cheviot.
The Covenanters had exchanged the brickbat and bludgeon style
of argument for the lighter but more pointed and effective weapon
—the pen—though they still acted in the most unchristian spirit
of intolerance and persecution towards those who would not adopt
their sentiments.


The Marquis of Hamilton was sent to Scotland with instructions
to do all he could, and a great deal that he couldn't. He was to
apprehend all the rebels, if possible; but not being of a very lively
apprehension, it was not likely he would succeed greatly in this
portion of his enterprise. He was to overturn the Covenant in six
weeks, if he found it convenient to do so, or in less if he found it
otherwise. In fact, his instructions might be summed up into an
order to go and make the best of a bad job—an attempt which
frequently ends in leaving a matter much worse than one originally
found it.


On his arrival at Holyrood his first effort to persuade the people
to give up the Covenant was met by an attempt to cram it down his
own throat, but he refused the proffered dose, and finding himself in
a very awkward fix, he could only hope to temporise. Charles wrote
to him to say, " he would rather die than give in; " but Hamilton,
knowing his master would have to die by deputy, and that the
deputy would be no other than himself, entreated his Majesty not to
be too open in his demonstrations of force against his Scotch
subjects. The Covenanters, on the other hand, declared they meant
nothing disrespectful to the throne, and that their pelting, shouting,
bullying, stoning, and protesting, were all to be considered as acts
performed in the most loyal spirit, and without the smallest idea
of disobedience to the royal mandate.


Some negotiations ensued between the two parties, and it was
resolved that a General Assembly should be held in Glasgow
forthwith, while a proclamation was issued for a Parliament to meet at
Edinburgh a few months afterwards. Hamilton knew the Assembly
would do no good, and wrote to the king to say so; but Charles
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 225 -->
answered, that it would at all events gain time, and the Scotch
might perhaps, if they met together in large numbers, come to the
scratch among themselves—a result that was exceedingly probable.


The Marquis of Hamilton reached Glasgow on the 17th of
November, 1638; and the General Assembly commenced on the 21st
with a sermon of such tremendous length, that the audience were
pretty well exhausted by the time it was concluded. The Assembly
would have then chosen a moderator; but Hamilton, starting up
with a polite " I beg your pardon," told them there was a little
Commission to read in order to explain by what authority he was
sitting there.


The Commission was excessively long, and all in Latin, which
enabled the officer entrusted with the commission of reading the
Commission, to extemporise rather extensively, by adding to the
original Latin a considerable quantity of Dog, which spun out the
time amazingly. The Assembly then again prepared to choose a
moderator, when Hamilton starting up, exclaimed—"I'm very sorry
to be so troublesome, but I must interrupt you again, for I wish you
to hear this letter from his Majesty."


Charles had purposely despatched a most unintelligible scrawl,
and the functionary employed to read it, prolonged the painful
operation of deciphering it as long as he could, until at length
the reading of the letter was concluded. The Assembly being again
about to proceed to elect a moderator, Hamilton once more was
upon his legs, with a " Dear me, you'll think me very tiresome,
but I have really something very particular to say;" and off he
went into a speech which seemed almost interminable, from its
excessive wordiness.


As all things must come to a conclusion, if not to an end—■
Hamilton's speech, for example, came to no end at all—the oration
of the Marquis was terminated at last, and for the fourth time the
Assembly had begun to choose a moderator, when Hamilton
interfered with a—•" Stop! stop ! stop ! Before you go any further,
remember that I protest against anything you may do, that will be
prejudicial to the king's prerogative."  
  
  
  VOL. II. U
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 226 -->
C
At length he was formally asked if he had quite done with his
interruptions, and having exhausted all his resources, he was
constrained to admit that he had no further remark to make, when
the election of a moderator was proceeded with. Alexander
Henderson, a minister of Fife,—which might well have been called, in the
strong language of Shakspeare, the "ear-piercing Fife," for it was
determined to make itself heard,—was chosen to the office, and
Hamilton was again on his legs to read a protest, but a general cry
of " Down, down ! Come, come; we've had enough of that," prevented
the Marquis from proceeding further in his obstructive policy. The
Assembly then chose one Archibald Johnston as clerk, and Hamilton,
determined to give the Covenanters one more lesson on the
Hamiltonian system, commenced protesting against the last appointment
they had made. The Marquis was, however, most unceremoniously
pooh-poohed, and the Assembly adjourned.


On the next day Hamilton began the old game of entering more
protests against the return of lay elders to the Assembly, but he was
treated with no more respect than if he had been a lay figure, and
was compelled to hold his tongue. Being checked in every attempt
to enter a protest on his own account, he insisted on patronising and
adopting a protest of the bishops who denied the jurisdiction of the
Assembly, but one of the clerks of session thundering out a
declaration that they would go on with their proceedings, Llamilton started
up once more, " begging pardon for being so very troublesome, but
adding that he really must protest to that."


Finding his protestations utterly useless, he thought it better to
protest to the whole thing en masse, and he accordingly dissolved
the General Assembly on the ensuing day. Henderson, the moderator
so called—on the lucus a non lucendo principle—from his being no
moderator at all, declared he was sorry they were going to lose the
pleasure of Hamilton's company, but the Assembly being assembled
had no intention to disperse. The Marquis, who had gone*about
muttering to himself " Oh, you know. This is quite absurd ! I'm no
use here," made the best of his way to England. He urged Charles
to take military measures against the Scotch, but they were
exceedingly active in making warlike preparations, and had got up a
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 227 -->
magazine at Edinburgh—no relation to Blackwood or Tait—which
was full of pikes, muskets, halberts, and other striking but very
offensive articles.


In the mean time the coffers of Charles were standing
perfectly empty, nobody in the city would take his paper upon any
terms, and indeed he could accept no bills, for there was no
Parliament in existence to draw the documents. He called upon the
judges, the clergy, and even the humbler servants of the crown  
  
  
  Charles I. does not know which way to turn.

to contribute part of their salaries to his necessities—a process
very like borrowing a portion of the wages of one's cook to pay
one's butcher.


The Covenanters had got together a tolerably large number of
troops, under General Leslie, and Hamilton was sent with five
thousand men to take Leith, but by the time he got into the waters
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P257_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 228 -->
of Leith(e) his soldiers seemed to be oblivious of their duties, for they
all deserted him.


Charles now thought it high time to go and see about the Scotch
business himself, and he started, per coach, for York, with the Duke
of Lennox and the Earl of Holland, as inside passengers. He was
met at that city by the Recorder, as the coach drew up to the Inn
door, and that functionary, in a fulsome speech, told him he had built
his throne on two columns of diamond—the parasite forgetting that
the old notion of "diamond cut diamond" might unpleasantly
suggest itself. At York Charles exacted an oath of fidelity from the
nobles, which was taken by all but Lords Saye and Brook, the
former declaring he should be a mere do if he consented tosay what
he did not mean, and the latter intimating that he was far too deep a
Brook to commit himself in the manner that the king required.


On the 29th of April Charles left York and repaired to Durham,
where the Bishop feasted him famously, giving him Durham mustard
every day, as a condiment to the delicious dishes that were
prepared for him. He next advanced to Newcastle, where the Mayor
entertained him sumptuously; but while the king went to dinner
he heard that many of his troops were going to desert, and by the
time he got to Berwick he was glad to listen to a proposition for a
truce, which after a good deal of trumpeting on both sides, was
arranged without a blow—except those conveyed through the
trumpet—on either.


A conference was next agreed upon, between the deputies of the
Covenanters and the Commissioners of the king; but, just as they
were commencing business, Charles walked in, saying, "I am told
you complain that you can't be heard! Now then, fire away, for I am
here to hear you." Lord Loudon, who was loud without being
effective, began to make a speech, but the king cut him short, and
Loudon, with all his loudness, remained inaudible during the rest of
the sitting. The parties to the negotiation were pretty well matched,
for royal roguery had to contend with Scotch cunning. " We must
give and take," said Charles; "Yes, that's all very well, but you
want us to do nothing but give, that you may do nothing but take,"
was the keen reply of the Caledonians.
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 229 -->

The assemblies of the Kirk were to be legalised, and an act of
oblivion was to be passed, which was very unnecessary on the king's
side, at least, for he was very apt to forget himself. Castles, forts,
ammunition, and even money, were to be delivered up to the king,
but part of the money having been spent, the cunning Scotchmen
accounted for the deficiency by saying to his Majesty, "You can't
eat your cake and have it,—that is very well known; and as we have
eaten your cake, that you can't have it is a natural consequence."


Charles was puzzled, though not quite convinced, by this
reasoning; but he thought it best to acquiesce for the sake of peace and
quietness in all the proposed arrangements. The two armies were
disbanded on the 24th of June, and Charles having stopped at
Berwick to buy a Tweedish wrapper, returned to England. The king
was now seized very seriously with a fit of his old complaint—the
want of money—and he called in Laud and Hamilton to consult with
Wentworth about a cure for the distressing malady. It was agreed
after some hesitation, to try another Parliament, and Wentworth
suggested that an Irish Parliament might be tried first, upon which
he was named Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, with the title of Earl of
Strafford, to give him more weight in making the experiment. The
Irish Parliament promised four subsidies off-hand, and two more if
required; but an Irish promise to pay, is little better than a bill
without a stamp, a promissory note without a date, or an I.O.U.
without a signature.


At length on the 13th of April, 1640, the English Parliament met,
and it contained many eminent men, among whom Hampden, who
sat for the town of Buckingham, was one of the most conspicuous.
Finch, who had been formerly Speaker, was now Lord Keeper, a
position he was most anxious to keep, and Mr. Serjeant Glanvil was
chosen to fill the Speaker's chair, upon which he made a long,
tedious speech that annoyed every one by its premises, as much
as it gratified every one by its conclusion. The debates very soon
assumed a most important air; and Pym, who from his effeminate
voice had got the name of Niminy Pyminy from some parasites
of the king, held forth with wondrous power, on the subject of
national grievances.
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 230 -->

Charles, who hated the word grievance—it is a pity he did not
abhor and avoid the act—ordered Parliament to attend him next
day in the Banqueting Hall, not to give them an opportunity of
filling their mouths, but for the purpose of stopping them. Charles
said nothing himself, but set Finch at them, who told them that they
must first vote the supplies, and that then they might luxuriate in
their grievances to their hearts' content, and having given the king
his cash, they would be at liberty to look out for their own
consolation. The Commons were not to be so cajoled, and on the 30th of
April, resolved themselves into a committee of the whole House on
the question of ship-money.


The Lords, who were servile to the king, no sooner heard of this
than they sent down to request a conference, but the Commons, who
could get no satisfactory answer to the questions "why?" and "what
about?" of course, on seeing the trap, declined tumbling into it. In
vain did Charles send down to say he had a large amount to make
up, and would be glad to know when it would be convenient to let
him have " that subsidy," and even Sir Henry Vane, his treasurer,
came—it can't be helped, the wretched pun must out—Yes! even
Vane presented himself in vain to know when the supplies would be
ready. The usual mode of getting rid of a pertinacious dun was
resorted to by saying, that an answer should be sent; and on the
5th of May, 1640, Charles, having asked the Speaker to breakfast,
and as some say, made him exceedingly drunk, ran down to the
House of Lords and dissolved the Parliament.


The state of the money-market was now truly frightful, and the
emissaries of Charles ran about in all directions crying out " Cash!
Cash! We must have Cash!" in every direction. Bullion was
got from the Tower by bullying the people who had charge of it,
and when no more good money was to be got, a proposition for
coining four hundred thousand pounds' worth of bad was coolly
suggested. " By Jove!" said the king, " when we can't snow
white, we must snow brown, and if we can't snow silver, we must
snow copper."  
  
  
  Such snow would, however, have been equivalent to its Latin
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 231 -->
appellation of nix, and the merchants foreseeing the danger of
depreciating the coinage, prevented the uttering of base money, which
would have been a source of unutterable confusion. The swindling
resorted to for supplying the necessities of the king was something
quite unsurpassed even in the annals of the most modern of
fraudulent bankruptcies. Charles got goods on credit at a high price, and
sold them for ready money at a low one; horses were lugged out of
carriages or carts, leaving the owners to draw their own vehicles
and their own conclusions; and indeed the king's emissaries went
about like a clown in a pantomime, appropriating and pocketing
everything they could lay their hands upon. " See what I've
found!" was a common cry at the snatching of a purse or anything
else for the use of the king, and the example of robbery being
set in high quarters, was sure to be followed in low with the
utmost activity.


The London apprentices were invited by a posting-bill stuck upon
the Royal Exchange to a soiree at Lambeth, for the purpose of
sacking the palace of the archbishop, but Laud was ready with cannon,
loaded with grape, and the apprentices, muttering that the grapes
were sour, abandoned their formidable intention.


Hostilities with Scotland having again broken out, Charles had
his hands quite full, and his pockets quite empty. The disputants
on both sides were ultimately glad to come to another truce, for they
found themselves after a great deal of fighting exactly where they
were before they began, except some of the killed and wounded, who,
unfortunately for them, were anything but just as they were at the
commencement of the contest. The Scots were to receive, according
to treaty, the sum of £850 per day for two months, and Charles,
wondering where the money was to come from, recollected that the
Commons had the glorious privilege of voting the supplies, together
with the glorious privilege of raising the money.

  SUCH an

as Charles is a

upon, but we must not

contemporaries cruelly
served him so. With a

the king, on the 3rd of

the Long Parliament.

him £5000 damages for his detention. On hearing the decision he
declared he would live no longer like a Prynne, but like a Prince;
and, by way of a beginning, he came down one flight of stairs, and
had " 2 pair, Mr. Prynne," instead of "3 pair, Mr. Prynne," marked
on the door-post of his chambers.


Strafford, who felt that his turn would very soon come, remained
out of town as long as he could, under the idea that, in conformity
with the proverb " out of sight, out of mind," the Commons, if they
did not see him, would never think of him. Charles, however, wrote
to him, telling him that " to keep so long out of sight he must,
indeed, be out of his mind," and insisted on his coming up to town
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P262_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 233 -->
to take his place in Parliament. He had scarcely entered the House
of Lords before Mr. Pym appeared at the bar to impeach Thomas
Earl Strafford in the name of all the Commons of England. The
Earl was taken to the Tower; and the chief secretary, Windebank,
had he not discovered something in the wind, which caused him
to take to flight, would assuredly have been obliged to follow the
favourite, or even to come in with him neck and neck, which means,
in this instance, neck or nothing. Finch, the Lord Keeper, was
next proceeded against, but, having made one speech in his own
defence, he availed himself of the natural qualities of the Finch
family, by taking to flight, or to speak more characteristically, he
\"hopped the twig," and fled to Holland. Several others were
threatened with Parliamentary vengeance, and Berkeley was
actually arrested while sitting as a Peer in his ermine, which he said
had been done because the mob had resolved to und-ermine the
Constitution.


On the 19th of January, 1641, Mr. Prideaux brought in a bill to
regulate the holding of Parliaments. Its object was to provide for
their being summoned by the Lords in case of the refusal of the king,
or by the Sheriffs in default of the Lords, or on the failure of King,
Lords, and Sheriffs, the thing was to be done by the people. There
was, by this measure, to be a new Parliament once in three years,
which was allowing rather amply for wear and tear; and though
Charles was very reluctant, he ultimately gave his consent to the
arrangement. Those very ill-used gentlemen, the Bishops, who are
always selected as a mark when the spirit of revolution is abroad
taking random shots at everything venerable, were of course not
allowed on this occasion to escape, and the Commons voted them
most unceremoniously out of Parliament.


The great event of the session, however, was the trial of Lord
Strafford, who, on the morning of Monday, the 22nd of March,
boated it, or rather barged it, up from the Tower to Westminster.
Everything, even the tide, was against him, and the Earl of Arundel,
who was notoriously his enemy, acted as High Steward at the trial.
The impeachment contained twenty-eight articles, every one of them
being capital, so that if Strafford had possessed twenty heads, it is  
  
  
  VOL. II. H H
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 234 -->
quite clear that the deep revenge of his accusers " had stomach for
them all." Strafford's reply was written out on two hundred sheets
of paper, but a good bold text hand must have been employed, for
the two hundred sheets, as well as the articles of impeachment, were
all got through on the first day of the trial.


It is rather a strange way of proceeding to take the reply before
hearing evidence in support of the charge; but such was the practice
on this momentous occasion. Arundel next called upon the managers
of the Commons to bring forward their proofs, and Pym began a very
roundabout address in the fashion of the period. The speech of Pym
was a reiteration of the charges in the Impeachment, served up with
a garniture of his own eloquence. Strafford declared it was a
conspiracy, of course, for it is a curious fact that the most flagrant
criminals have always been—if they are to be believed, which we
need scarcely say they are not—the victims of a cruel combination
against injured innocence. Strafford asked for time to plead, but he
had not taken out a summons in the regular way, and accordingly
only half-an-hour was awarded him. He nevertheless made such
good use of this short time, that he made a capital speech, and
concluded with a puzzle almost as good as the old original inquiry, with
reference to the red herring and the sack of coals.* " For if," said
he, " the one thousand misdemeanors will not make a felony, how
will twenty-eight misdemeanors make a treason ?"


The trial was continued from day to day, and on the ioth of
April Pym walked knowingly up to the bar with a variety of nods
and winks, to intimate that he had a matter of vast importance to
communicate. The Assembly having ordered the door to be locked
to prevent intrusion—as if the housemaid might have wandered in
with her broom—there was a general cry of " Now then, what is it ?
Let's have it out without all this mystery." Pym hereupon produced
a copy of notes taken at a meeting of the privy council, in which
Strafford was reported to have told the king that he was " absolved
and loosed from all rule and government." The point wascon
* Every one knows, or ought to know, the question of the arithmetical enthusiast:
—" If a red-herring costs three-halfpence, what will a sack of coals come to?" Ans.—

<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 235 -->
sidered a strong one; but if Strafford had told Charles he was the
Emperor of Morocco, and might turn all his subjects into morocco
slippers by trampling them under his feet, the minister's having
merely said so would not have made the fact, and he could not have
been liable for it unless it had really happened. Verba rum acta
seemed, however, to be the motto of his judges, who took the word
for the deed in numerous instances. Strafford, having made the best
answer he could to this part of the charge, was told by Arundel, that
if he had anything more to say, the sooner he said it the better, for
his judges were very anxious to have the pleasure of condemning
him. The fact was, that the customary sympathy of Englishmen
for a poor fellow in a mess was beginning to show itself, and the
Commons feared that the trial would not " keep " a great deal longer
if they did not speedily make an end of it. The matter was
accordingly hurried on, and on the 21st of April, the bill of attainder
passed the Commons by a very large majority. The numbers were
204 against 59, which of course did not include the " tellers," for if
it had done so, Hume, Hallam, and the rest of us, must have been
comprised, for we are all of us the " tellers " of this sad story.


When the bill went up to the Peers, their Lordships were not at
all in a hurry to despatch it, and the Commons kept sending up
messages to know " How about that little Bill ? " and begging that
the Upper House would immediately settle it. It was rumoured that
Strafford intended to escape, but it was rather idle to speculate upon
the intentions of a man who was utterly unable to accomplish them.
He offered a bribe of twenty-two thousand pounds to Balfour, the
Lieutenant of the Tower; but that virtuous individual scorned the
filthy dross, though some brute who has no appreciation of the great
and good, has hinted that Balfour either expected more, or was
afraid that wnat was offered would not be forthcoming.


Charles, who was very anxious to make the favourite safe, though
the odds were terribly against him, sent for the Lords and Commons,
whom he begged, when drawing up their sentence, to draw it as
mild as possible. He said he had listened to the evidence, and he
really did not see how they could commit the Earl. But Pym
replied, sotto voce, that " none are so blind as those who won't see; "
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 236 -->
and Charles could elicit nothing satisfactory. At the next sitting of
the Parliament a furious mob was collected outside, and the Lords
naturally expressed their disinclination to being bullied into haste on
the subject of the bill of attainder. Upon this, one Dr. Burgess,
who had some weight with the people, went out to disperse them,
and though he said some sharp things which caused that intolerable
nuisance—a wag—to cry out, " Come, Burgess, none of your sauce,"
he succeeded in his object.


The state of nervous agitation in which the whole country was
plunged at about this period may be conceived by a little anecdote
which is told on the best authority—that is to say, the best that
happens to be available. Sir Walter Earl was in the midst of a
cock-and-bull story about some plot that had been hatching to make
a sort of Girandola of the Parliament, by blowing it up with a
splendid display of fire-works, in the midst of which the Speaker
was to have gone off like a Jack in the Box, when the members, who
were shivering and shaking like a grove of aspens, were startled by
the following incident:—Two very corpulent members happening to
stand upon one plank, which was rather the worse for wear, caused
the floor to crack, and the Commons thought it was all up, or
rather all down, with them. The utmost confusion prevailed, and
somebody at once started off to fetch the train-bands, who acted as
the police of the period. It turned out to be a false alarm, or to
speak more correctly, a real alarm resting on false premises, for
the flaw in the floor had been the cause of this not altogether
groundless terror.


On the 7th of May the Lords passed the bill of attainder against
Strafford, as well as another bill, abrogating the power of the king
to dissolve the Parliament. The House was thin, and it may have
happened that the recent accident with the two fat members in the
Commons operated as a warning to corpulent Peers not to attend till
their locus standi had been looked to by the carpenter.


It now remained to be seen whether Charles would give his
consent to the execution of the favourite, and poor Strafford, feeling that
his life hung upon a thread, sent a long yarn, in the shape of a letter,
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 237 -->
to his royal master. The king summoned his privy council to advise
him what step to take, when honest Jack Juxon, the plain-sailing
Bishop of London, exclaimed, bluntly, " I'll tell you what it is, your
Majesty; if you've any doubts about his guilt don't you go and sign
his bill of attainder for all the Bills—no, nor the Bobs—nor the
Dicks, in Christendom." Others, however, gave him opposite advice,
and the scene ended by his resolving to give his assent, though he
did so with his pocket-handkerchief before his eyes, but whether from
emotion or a cold in his head, is still an "open question" with all
historians. On the 12th of May, 1641, poor Strafford met his doom
with such heroic fortitude that, though he became shorter by a head
in a physical sense, his moral stature was considerably heightened
in the eyes of posterity.


The death of Strafford was the signal for the abandonment of
office by several of his friends, who thought it better to live with
resignation than die with resignation at this very trying juncture.
Bills were passed for abolishing the Star-Chamber, and the Court of
High Commission, as well as for preventing the Parliament from being
dissolved, except by its own consent; so that Charles became like a
king in a game of skittles, whose downfall was only a question of
time and circumstance.


Being dreadfully in want of a little loyalty to comfort him, and
finding very little in England—and that of the weakest kind—the
Sovereign paid a visit to Scotland, where he knew he could have as
much as he wanted, if he chose to pay for it. His visit to that
country was fast coming to a close when news reached him of a
rebellion in Ireland, where the descendants of the early settlers, who
were for settling everybody, and had taken the name of the "Lords
of the Pale," were causing numbers to " kick the bucket."


The republican spirit had now broken out in full force; and the
more the king went on doing what he was asked, the more the
Commons went on being dissatisfied. At length he determined to
try a bit of firmness, and walked into the House of Commons one
morning to demand the impeachment of five members, two of whom
were Pym and Hampden. Charles entered the Assembly quite alone,
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 238 -->
and walking up to the chair of the Speaker, who had risen on the
king's arrival, his Majesty glided into it. He stated that he had
come to take the five members into custody: but there was
something so derogatory in the idea of " every monarch his own
policeman," that the Commons were rather disgusted, and greeted him
with shouts of " Privilege ! Privilege ! "


Having made up his mind that " this sort of thing would not do,"
he determined to go out 0/ town, and repaired to York, where he was
soon joined by a party of volunteers more select than numerous.
Charles was in that state of cashlessness so often ascribed by
history to kings, who, nominally possessed of a crown, are positively
not worth a shilling.


He had sold his wife's jewels, and laid out the produce in arms
and ammunition, which he gave out as far as they would go to his few
friends; but the distribution was a mournful business. There were
scarcely swords enough to go round, and the gunpowder was served
out in little packets like so many doses of salts to the small band of
Royalists. They mustered the money for a manifesto, in which
Essex, one of his apostate generals, was denounced in very large
type; and the king having corrected the proof of the poster, ordered
one hundred to be worked off and stuck up at the earliest
opportunity. His Majesty and suite—which Strype tells us was short and
suite—repaired to Nottingham, where the cause of the sovereign got
a sort of lift by the hoisting of the royal standard.


When Charles found it necessary to draw the sword, he felt that
he had nothing else to draw, for his funds were quite exhausted.
Everything seemed to go against him, and even the elements
themselves were unfavourable, for the standard which his friends had
found it so difficult to hoist, was blown down, and came rattling
through a skylight on to the heads of the royalists. The civil war
had now regularly commenced, and the first battle was fought at
Edge Hill, in Warwickshire, where Prince Rupert—the inventor of
mezzotinto engraving—left the print of his sword, and several proofs
of his valour, on the ranks of the king's enemies. After fighting all
day the two armies put up for the night, and facing each other the
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 239 -->
next morning, they evidently did not like each other's looks, for both
parties retired. Had the king's troops gone to London, they might
have done some good, but they loitered about Reading, and by the
time they got to Turnham Green it was occupied by 24,000 men,
though where they managed to turn 'em in at Turnham Green, is
somewhat mysterious.*


On the 15th of April, the parliamentarians invested Reading, but
the king, having nothing to invest, could not compete for this eligible
investment. Essex, who had managed the transaction, did not
continue long a holder, but fell back to Thame, where a skirmish took
place that would have been literally a tame affair if the illustrious
Hampden had not perished in the melee.


Essex was one of the worst men possible to be chosen as a leader?
for he had an unconquerable propensity to gib—which was the only
invincibility he possessed—and he was consequently falling back
whenever he should have been going forward. He had gibbed from
Reading to Thame, and he now gibbed again from Thame to London,
where it became a saying among the common people, "Oh, that's
Essex : I know him by the cut of his jib."


The civil war continued to rage with varying success until the
Battle of Marston Moor, where the royalists, under Prince Rupert,
sustained a defeat they never after recovered, and the only use they
could make of their right and left wing, was to fly for safety. After
this reverse, Charles attempted to get up a treaty called the Treaty of
Uxbridge, which after twenty days of wrangling between the
Commissioners of the Parliament and those sent by the king—the
former wanting everything, and the latter conceding nothing—fell
completely to the ground. Cromwell had contrived that Sir Thomas,
now Lord Fairfax, should be appointed General of the Parliamentary
Army, so that the responsibility of failure should rest upon that
individual; while the wily brewer, who knew how to take his
measures, would have artfully secured the merit of any success for
himself. The Battle of Naseby was the last decisive blow, which, in

the graphic words of one of our early writers, " put the nasal organ
of royalty completely out of joint." Charles behaved very gallantly,
and so did Rupert; but when the former cried out to his cavalry,
\"One charge more and we win the day! " he might just as well
have exclaimed, " Twopence more, and up goes the donkey," for his
words produced no effect. " Thank you, we've had enough of it,"

  seemed to be imprinted on every countenance; and after a few more

reverses, Charles formed the rash deliberation of throwing himself
upon the generosity of the Scotch.


He might just as well have thrown himself on the pavement
beneath the monument, as the sequel proved; for the Scotch at once
set to work to see what profit was to be made by the sale of the royal
fugitive. After a good deal of haggling, they sold the sovereign,
who had thrown himself upon their generosity, for four hundred
thousand pounds; and they no doubt silenced their consciences—

<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 241 -->
if they ever had any—by saying, " It's just a matter of beesness,
ye ken," to any one who remonstrated with them upon their
mercenary baseness.


The royal prisoner was shut up for some weeks at Holmby Castle,
in Northamptonshire, but after a few weeks Cromwell sent one Joyce,
formerly his tailor and afterwards a cornet in Fairfax's troop of horse,
to " smug " the unhappy king and carry him to the army.


The House of Commons became exceedingly jealous of the
military influence that prevailed, but the people rather sided with the
soldiers; for the parliament had, of course in its great love of liberty,
taken the liberty to lay on taxes to an extent unprecedented in the
annals of royal rapacity. It is a fact worth remembering, that the
people frequently find their friends more costly than their enemies.


In the autumn of 1647, the King was sent to Hampton Court,
where he was allowed some indulgences, such as going out to spend
the day at Sion House, where two of his children were remaining as
parlour boarders with the Duke of Northumberland. Some Puritans
having given indications of their imagining that they had a spiritual
call to do some mischief to the king, his Majesty resolved not to be
at home to such a call if he could possibly help it, and leaving
Hampton Court with three attendants he reached the coast of
Hampshire. It was noticed at the time that Charles had probably heard
of the celebrated Hampshire hogs, and fancied therefore that
Hampshire must be the best place for him to go to in the hope of
saving his bacon. He resigned himself to Colonel Hammond, the
Governor of the Isle of Wight, who placed the royal fugitive in
Carisbrook Castle; where a bowling-green was arranged and a
summer-house built, so that Charles could fancy himself, if he liked,
in a suburban tea-garden. The king was a capital bowler, and when
sorrow came across his mind he would try and " drown it in the
bowls " which Colonel Hammond was so good as to provide him with.


In the September of 1648, another conference was attempted, and
Charles took a furnished lodging at a private house in Newport,
where the commissioners came to consult with him. They found him
much altered, and with his hair so grey as to bespeak the fact that  
  
  
  VOL. II. II
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 242 -->
care had been busy in peppering his head, which he declared had
got into that state during his anxious sojourn at Oxford; and this
peculiar combination of tints retains to this day the title of the
Oxford Mixture.


The Parliament would have been glad to diminish the influence
of the army by a successful negotiation with the king; but while
terms were being discussed, Cromwell, who never brewed
half-andhalf, struck a blow at both parties. He sent one of his draymen
named Pride, who had risen from a seat on the shafts of his dray to
a colonelcy in the army, to blockade the Parliament-house with a
body of troops, and let in only those members who were favourable
to the views of his late employer. We, who cannot imagine Barclay
or Perkins going the entire in the style of their predecessor in trade,
nor conceive Meux and Co. meddling with the Crown, except to
supply it with beer, are of course astonished at the insolence of
Cromwell. He nevertheless gained his point, for he set the
Parliament at defiance, and had the king removed to Hurst Castle, in
Hampshire, which was so dull that Charles could not help remarking
that coming to Hurst was like going to be buried. He was again
removed to Windsor, and subsequently to St. James's Palace, where
the guards were ordered to call him Charles Stuart, in order to show
the magnanimity of the revenge of such a man as Cromwell. The
king was exposed to every petty insult that little-mindedness could
suggest or coarse brutality execute. In this respect the " liberals "
of England in 1649 set an example which the "liberals" of France
followed in the treatment of their own fallen and powerless sovereign
upwards of a century afterwards. The only comfort he enjoyed was
the society of poor old Jack Juxon, the bishop who had been faithful
to him in all his adversity.


It was now determined to bring the king to trial, and on the 20th
of January the proceedings commenced in Westminster Hall, when
upon its being declared that Charles was accused in the name of the
people, a shrill voice exclaimed, " Pooh, pooh! not a tenth part of
them." The ushers looked in vain to see who was disturbing the
audience, and the soldiers were ordered to fire into the corner whence
the voice proceeded, until it turned out that Lady Fairfax was the
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 243 -->
individual by whom the proceedings had been interrupted. She was
a warm politician, and with her husband had espoused the
parliamentary cause, but was disgusted like him with the brutal use that
the "liberals" were making of their triumph. Charles demurred to
the jurisdiction of his judges for three days, but, on the 27th, they
found him guilty, and sentenced him to be beheaded three days
afterwards. The "people," imitating the conduct of some of their
"friends," insulted the fallen monarch in his misfortune, and many
a malicious, low-bred ass, tried to get a kick at the chained lion.
Happily the people in our own days are very superior to the people
of the time of Charles, and there is no sympathy among the masses
with ungenerous persecution, whatever maybe the rank of the victim.


As Charles quitted the hall after his conviction, a wretched
miscreant displayed a toad-like venom by spitting in the king's face,
which drew from the sovereign the true remark, " Poor souls! they
would treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence." While
chronicling an act disgraceful to human nature, we must not forget
to put down what is on the credit side—namely, a blessing instead
of an insult from one of the guard, who was struck to the ground for
giving way to this creditable impulse.


We draw a veil over the closing scene, for our history is not a
register of murders; but whoever reads attentively the details of the
sacrifice of Charles I. will see the original of one of the darkest scenes
in the French Revolution.


The death-warrant for the execution of Charles the First was
signed by fifty-nine of his Judges, the list beginning with the name
of John Bradshaw, and ending with that of Miles Corbet. Few of
them rose to much distinction, and still fewer have left descendants
capable of acquiring fame, for there is scarcely a renowned
patronymic in the entire catalogue. A man in a visor performed the
murderous ceremony of striking off the king's head; and we cannot
be surprised that the executioner was ashamed to show his face on
such an occasion.


Though the nation had stood by, in the most apathetic manner,
while the mischief was doing, it was no sooner done, than everybody
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 244 -->
became very indignant and very sorrowful. Women went into fits,
men took to drinking, and some went so far as to commit suicide
rather than survive their murdered sovereign. This sympathy was
all peculiarly English, and, in fact, a little too much so; for it is the
fault of our countrymen to make a great deal too much of the dead
and far too little of the living. Neglect, or even starvation, is
frequently the fate of one who, after his decease, has his merits

recognised by subscription and a monument. Genius not
unfrequently asks in vain for bread when living, but when dead gets a
stone awarded him.


Charles was in the 49th year of his age, and the 24th of his reign,
when he was brought to the scaffold. We regret that we cannot
give a favourable character to this unfortunate person out of place
—for he certainly was completely out of place on the throne of
England. His disposition was mixed, like human nature in general;
and indeed, what is mankind, as the philosopher would ask, but the
"mixture as before" incessantly repeated? He was dignified, it is
true, but so is the representative of the "fifth noble" or "tenth
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P274_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 245 -->
senator," in an opera or play, and he was temperate also to an
extent that might have fitted him for the chair of a tee-total lodge,
but not for the throne of a vast empire. He was not avaricious, but
if he spent money freely it was because he freely helped himself to
the money of other people. He was humane to such an extent, that
\"he would not have hurt a fly;" but it may be said that a fly never
did him any harm, and hostility therefore, to that imbecile insect,
would have been at once brutal and undignified. The man who
would hurt a fly, must indeed be very hard up for a victim to his
malevolence, and Charles cannot, therefore, have much credit given
him for his amiability towards that humble member of the class of
diptera. The manners of Charles were not much in his favour; " but
it would not have mattered much," says the incorrigible Strype,
\"that he was a bit of a bear, had he been otherwise bearable."


In a commercial country, like ours, his swindling propensities
will always tell against him, and his insatiable desire to obtain
money, under false pretences, was quite unworthy of his exalted
station, or, indeed, of any station but that where the police are
paramount. It is true that his subjects would have kept him rather
hard up for cash; and he often declared that the Long Parliament
reduced him repeatedly to very short commons. Hume has
endeavoured to give Charles the reputation of being a man of "probity
and honour; " but it must have been the sort of honour said to
prevail among thieves, for when he could not get money by honest
means—which he seldom could—he never scrupled to rob for it.


In person, Charles had a sweet but melancholy expression, a sort
of agro dolce, which made his portrait not quite a Carlo Dolce to look
upon. His features were regular, but he was not vain; and he
would often say or think " that he should not care about a regular
nose or chin, so that he could make both ends meet by having a
regular salary." He was an excellent horseman; but it is one thing
to be skilful in the management of the bridle, and another to be
adroit in holding the reins of power. His equestrian
accomplishments would have been useful to him had fate thrown him into
another circle, where his favourite Buckingham, as clown to the
ring, would also have been in his proper position.
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 246 -->

The men of letters of Charles's reign were numerous and
illustrious. Ford, the dramatist, whose depth it is difficult to fathom;
Ben Jonson, surnamed the Rare, and as it has been prettily said by
somebody, " the rarer the better; " with Philip Massinger, belonged
to the period. Speed the topographer, commonly called the " slow
coach; " Burton, the famous anatomist of melancholy, and familiarly
known as the sad dog; Spelman, whose writings possess no
particular spell; Cotton, who has furnished a lot of printed stuffs; and a
few others, constituted the literary illuminators of the age, by their
moral and intellectual moulds, dips, or rushlights.

the republican beggars were
on horseback, and began at a
rapid pace the ride whose
terminus we need not mention.
On the 5th of February, 1649,
a week after the execution of
Charles, the Commons had the
impudence to vote the House
of Peers "both useless and
dangerous." One of the next
steps of the lower House was
to vent a sort of brutal
malignity upon unfeeling objects, and

his statues. The Commons thought, no doubt, to pave the way to
a republic by macadamizing the road with the emblems of royalty.


Considerable discussion has been raised upon the question of the
right of a nation to decapitate its king; and, of course, if the people
may do as they please with their own, they may do anything. The
judgment of posterity has very properly pronounced a verdict of
"Wilful Murder" against the regicides, and we have no wish to
disturb this very fair decision. It is very unlikely that a similar state
of things will ever arise again in England; but, if such were to be
unhappily the case, there are, in these, enlightened times, numerous
pacific and humane modes of meeting the emergency. " Between
dethroning a prince and punishing him, there is," as Hume well
observes, " a wide difference;" and unless the professed
humanitymongers should get fearfully ahead—unless the universal
philanthropists should gain an ascendency over public opinion—there is no fear
that kings or aristocrats will ever be butchered again, for the
promotion of " universal love " and " brotherhood."


AVhen Charles was no more, the republicans continued to show
their paltry malevolence by making insulting propositions as to the
disposal of his family. It was suggested that the Princess Elizabeth
should be bound apprentice to a button-maker; but the honest
artificer to whom the proposal was made generously hoped that his
buttons might be dashed before he became a party to so petty an
arrangement. Happily for the princess, death, by making a
loophole for her escape, saved her from being reduced to the necessity of
making buttons.


A Committee of Government had been hitherto sitting at Derby
House, which was now changed into the Executive Council, with
Bradshaw, as president, and Milton, the poet, as his secretary: the
latter having being employed no doubt on account of his powerful
imagination to conceive some possible justification for the conduct of
the regicides. Duke Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Capel, the
last of whom had bounded away like a stag, but was seized at the
corner of Capel Court, were all tried and beheaded.  
  
  
  The usual consequences of the triumph of the " great cause of
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 248 -->
liberty," as advocated by noisy demagogues, and of the ascendency
of the soi-disant friends of the people, very soon became evident. It
was declared treason to deny the supremacy of Parliament, which
might indeed lay claim to supremacy in oppression, pride, and
intolerance. The " freedom of the press " was completely stopped;
and, in fact, there was the customary direct antagonism between
principle and practice which too frequently marks the conduct of the
hater of all tyranny except his own, and the ardent friend of his kind,
which is a kind that we do not greatly admire.


The king's eldest son was proclaimed as Charles II., in Scotland
and Ireland, which caused Cromwell to say, " I must go and see
about that," and to start at once for Dublin. Having done
considerable damage, notwithstanding the resistance of some of the Irish
youth, who went by the name of the Dublin Stout, he left his
son-inlaw, Ireton, to look after Ireland, thinking, perhaps, he would be
acceptable from the semi-nationality of his name, while he himself
returned to England. He took up his abode in London, at a place
called the Cockpit, where he was visited by several persons of
consequence; and the new lord of the Cockpit enjoyed the Gallic privilege
of having a good crow upon his own dunghill.


Montrose now made an attempt in Scotland in favour of
Charles II., but being defeated, he fled and sought refuge with a
Scotch friend, who, of course, sold him for what he would fetch, and
made two thousand pounds by the business transaction. Poor
Montrose was hanged at Edinburgh, on a gallows thirty feet high, which
justifies us in saying that cruelty was carried to an immense height,
on this deplorable occasion. Charles himself now took the field,
having landed at the Frith of Cromarty, and had collected a tolerably
large army under Lesley. Cromwell instantly started for Scotland,
with a considerable force, and attacked the royalists at Dunbar,
where he encouraged his own troops by a quantity of religious cant,
which contrasted strangely with the sanguinary nature of his object.
After cutting to pieces all that fell in their way, the Puritan humbugs
set to at psalm-singing with tremendous vehemence. This mixture
of butchery and bigotry was one of the most disgusting
characteristics of Cromwell and his ferocious followers. Charles, having
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 249 -->
fled towards the Highlands, intended leaving Scotland; but some
people there asked him to stop and take a bit of dinner, with the
promise of a coronation in the evening.


The reunion took place, but it was rather dull, and Charles
determined to make his way towards England. Cromwell resolved to
pursue him, and this active friend of religion and humanity, having
met a few royalists on the road, deliberately " cut them to pieces."
On the 3rd of September, 1651, the Battle of Worcester was fought,
with success to the republican force; and poor Charles was obliged
to escape as well as he could by assuming a variety of disguises,
though how he got the extensive wardrobe his dramatic assumptions
entailed a necessity for, is not quite obvious. He arrived at
Shoreham, near Brighton, in a footman's livery, and the " lad with the
white cockade," as the old song called him, obtained a situation in a
coal barge, in which he was carried to France. The captain of the
collier must have been an odd sort of person, to take a footman
with him on the voyage, but perhaps the coal-heavers of that day
were more refined than they are at present.


Cromwell was triumphantly received in London, and the cloven
foot soon began to peep out from the high-low of the crafty
republican. He accepted Hampton Court Palace as his residence, and an
estate of 4000/. a year was voted to him, without the purity of his
intentions offering any obstacle to his receiving it.


The Parliament was now getting into disrepute, and Cromwell
thought he would take advantage of its loss of popularity, to
increase his own stock, whereupon the game of " diamond cut
diamond " was commenced between them. The Parliament had now
been sitting for some years, and people began to think there
might be too much of a good thing, even in an assembly of
redhot patriots, that had hanged a king, and sent the country into a
fit of melancholy, by prohibiting, by law, everything in the shape
of cheerfulness.


In those days, a joke would lead the perpetrator to the gibbet,
and a pun was so highly penal—as, perhaps, it ought to be—that a
dull dog who had dropped one by mistake, was called upon to find  
  
  
  VOL. II. K K
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 250 -->
heavy securities for his good behaviour. The nation was thrown
into the dismals by Act of Parliament, and England became—to
use a simile that would, at the time, have sent our heads smack
to the block—the very centre of gravity. Cromwell, seeing that the
Parliament was going down in favour every day, resolved to raise
himself by giving the finishing blow to it. He sounded Whitelock,
to whom he put the question, " What if a man should take upon
himself to be king ?" and thus Whitelock got a key to Cromwell's
intentions. The old man—Silverpate, as some call him—did not
take to the notion, and Cromwell was exceedingly cool to him
ever afterwards.


There was a meeting at Oliver's lodgings, on the 20th of April,
to discuss the best method of getting rid of the Parliament; and
Cromwell, hearing the Commons were in the act of passing a very
obnoxious bill, got up from his chair, in a very excited state, and
told some soldiers to follow him. He swelled his little band with
the sentinels on duty, whom he called out of their sentry-boxes, as
he passed, and entered the House, attended by Lambert, a file of
musketeers, and a few officers. He took his seat, and listened to
the debate, but when the Speaker was going to put the motion, he
started up, saying to Harrison—" Now's the time; I must—indeed
I must! " when Harrison pulled him back by the skirts of his coat,
saying to him, " Can't you be quiet ? Just think what you're doing."
He then proceeded to address the assembly, but soon got dreadfully
unparliamentary in his language, and rushing from his seat to the
floor of the House, got very personal. He next stamped on the floor,
when his musketeers entered, and, pointing to the Speaker, who was
of course raised above the rest, he cried " Fetch him down ! " when
the Speaker was seized by the robe and pulled into the midst of the
assembly. Pointing to Algernon Sydney, Cromwell next cried " Put
him out! " and out he went, like a farthing rushlight.


Algernon was very young, and exhibited at first a degree of
boyish obstinacy, mixed with infantine insolence, which caused him
to be refractory, or—to use a simile in conformity with the image of
the rushlight—to flare up in the socket. He, for a moment, refused
to go; which caused Harrison to tap him gently on the shoulder,
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 251 -->
and say to him, in a mild, but resolute tone, " Come, come, young
gentleman; if you don't go out quietly, we must put you out." The
child seemed doubtful whether to turn refractory or not, when it
suddenly appeared to occur to him that it would be useless to resist;
and, just as Harrison had his hands on the lad's shoulders, to impart
to him sufficient momentum to have sent him flying through the
door, young Algernon made up his mind that he would go quietly.
Cromwell stood, in fact, like a dog in the midst of so many rats; a
position he had perhaps learned to assume, from his residence at the
Cockpit; and he next flew at the mace, exclaiming—" Take away
that bauble ! " The mace was most unceremoniously hurried off,
when, after a little more abuse against several of his old friends,
the House was completely cleared, and there was an end to the
Long Parliament.


Nothing could exceed the well-bred dogism or utter currishness
of the Commons on this occasion, for not one of them offered the
smallest resistance to the violence of Cromwell. When they had all
sneaked out he locked and double-locked the door, put the keys in
his pocket, and carried them to his lodgings. He admitted that he
had not intended to have gone so far when he first entered the House,
but the mean-spiritedness of the members had urged him on to the
course he had adopted.


Thinking that he might as well make a day of it, he proposed to
Harrison and Lambert to walk with him to Derby House, and the
three stalked into the room where the Council of State was sitting.
Cromwell at first pretended to listen with attention to what was
going on, and gave an occasional loud ejaculation of " Hear ! " but
Bradshaw, who was presiding, soon felt that the cheer was ironical.
Business was permitted to proceed in this way for a few minutes,
when the Council felt it was being " quizzed," and Bradshaw,
giving an incredulous look at Cromwell, the latter made no longer
a secret of his intention. " Come, come," he cried, " there's been
enough of this; go home, and get to bed, and don't come here again
until you've a message from me that you're wanted." The hint was
immediately taken by Bradshaw, who started up and ran for it—for
he was afraid of rough treatment—and he presently had close at
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 252 -->
his heels the whole of his colleagues. Thus, within the space of
a few hours, Cromwell had broken up the Council of State and
dissolved the Long Parliament.


Cromwell, having made short work of the Long Parliament,
proceeded to supply its place by a legislature of his own composition,
and the enemy of absolute monarchy proved himself an absolute
humbug by acts of the most arbitrary and designing character. His
pretended patriotism had in fact been a struggle on his part to
decide whether the business of despotism should remain in the
hands that were " native and to the manner born " to it, or whether
he should start on his own account as a monopolist of tyranny to be
practised for his own aggrandisement. The new Parliament was a
miscellaneous collection of impostors and scamps, with a slight
mixture of honest men, but these were too few to make the thing
respectable. Cromwell now began to put on the external semblance
of religion with an extravagance of display that gives us every
reason to doubt his sincerity. As the man of straw frequently covers
himself with jewellery, a good deal of which may be sham; so
Cromwell enveloped himself in all the externals of sanctity, which we
firmly believe penetrated no further than the surface.


One of the principal members of the new Parliament was a fellow
named Barbone or Barebone, a leather-seller and currier, who
attempted to curry favour by an affectation of extreme holiness.
The legislative assembly subsequently got the name of the
Barebones Parliament from the person we have named, and the whole
pack of humbugs usurped the powers of the state by pretending they
"had a call" to take upon them the duties of government.


It may generally be observed, that they who make piety a
profession look very sharply out for professional profits, and if they
are desirous of taking what is not justly their own, they soon get up
an imaginary "call" to urge them to the robbery. Cromwell
formally handed over to them the supreme authority—which,
by-thebye, was not his to give—and the first day of their meeting was
devoted to praying and preaching with a view to giving the public
an idea of their excessive sanctity. They soon set to work in their
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 253 -->
career of mischief, and began by abolishing the Court of Chancery,
on account of its delays, which was like killing a horse because it
did not happen to go at full gallop. They certainly expedited the
suits, and brought them to a conclusion about as effectually as one

would accelerate a steam-engine by shutting up the safety-valve, and
allowing it to go to smash with the utmost possible rapidity. They
nominated as judges a new set of lawyers, whose qualification was
that they were not in the law; and there is no doubt the Parliament
would have dissolved every institution in the kingdom if the
members had not dissolved themselves on the 12th of December,
1654, at the suggestion of Cromwell.

<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 254 -->

The old constitutional principle, that too many cooks spoil the
broth, having been rapidly exemplified, it was declared expedient to
have "a commonwealth in a single person," or, in other words, to
have a king with a democratic name, which is the invariable result
of the policy of red-hot republicans. Cromwell was of course the
unit who had put himself down as A. i, for the new office, and he
succeeded in choosing himself or getting himself chosen by the title
of Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Thus, though
the people had cut off the head of a real king, another head grew
in its place, for Government is like the Hydra, which must have a
head, however often the process of decapitation may be carried into
execution. The brewer had, in fact, mashed up the constitution as
completely as if he had used one of his own mash-tubs for the
purpose, and his upstart insolence reached such a point, that the now
well-known expression, " He doesn't think small beer of himself,"
was first applied in reference to this dealer in ale and stout, who, it
was clumsily observed, had " gone the entire " in his great audacity.


While these things were going on at home, the English fleet had
been engaged with Von Tromp, or Trump, abroad, and the Dutch
sailor behaved like the article which his name delicately indicates.
The Dutch for some time, though they only had this Von Trump,
carried off all the honours, and sometimes succeeded even by tricks;
but at length the distinguished Trump was obliged to " shuffle off the
mortal coil," and though he would gladly have revoked his
determination to "cut in" to such a desperate game as an engagement
with the English, he played it out to the last with all his wonted
courage. The only remaining Trump, looking whistfully round him,
fell by a blow from a knave who was in the suit and service of the
English. When the last breath was blown out of the highly
respectable Trump, the war between the Dutch and the English was
at an end, and the Protector had time to follow out his principles by
protecting himself with the utmost vigilance.


One of his chief difficulties arose from the eagerness of the various
liberal sects in religion to oppress each other in the name of brotherly
love and universal harmony. This difficulty in quieting the demands
of each to exterminate the others taught him lessons of diplomacy,
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 255 -->
and Cromwell soon became the most accomplished "do" that ever
had a place in the pages of history. Though he recommended great
tolerance in their quarrels with each other, they no sooner began to
abuse him than he threw some of them into prison, reminding us of
the celebrated apostle of Temperance,- who, in a fit of intoxication,
broke the windows of a public-house for the purpose of assisting the
triumph of the " grand principle."


Cromwell, who was a clever man, and though a brewer was averse
to doing things by half-and-half, made some legal appointments that
gave general satisfaction. He promoted Hale—with whom he was
hale fellow well met—to the Bench of the Common Pleas, and he
was fortunate enough to obtain a recognition of his protectorate from
the Governments of France, Spain, and Portugal.


On the 3rd of September, 1654, which was Sunday, Cromwell, as
Protector, first met his new Parliament, and played the part of a
king, in all its most essential points, even down to the delivery of a
speech from the throne, remarkable for the badness of its grammar,
the antiquity of its language, and the utter emptiness of most of its
sentences. He abused the levellers, for, with the skill of political
engineering, he desired to level down no lower than the " dumpy
level " at which he had arrived; and while eulogising liberty of
conscience, he admitted it to be a capital thing so long as it did not
extend to the formation of opinions unfavourable to the Protector's
own position. He spoke glowingly of the beauty of free thoughts,
but hinted that, lest these thoughts should be more free than
welcome, the people had better keep their thoughts to themselves
as much as possible.


At the close of Cromwell's speech, the Commons sneaked back to
their House, where they elected Lenthall their Speaker, and appointed
the 13th of September a day of humiliation, as if there had not been
humiliation enough for the country in the conduct it had been
recently pursuing. The Protector soon began to put his despotic
principles in force, for his position having been debated rather freely,
he sent for the members of Parliament to the Painted Chamber, and
told them very plainly that he had made up his mind to stand no
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 256 -->
impertinence. " You wanted a republic," said he, " and you have
got it; so you had better be satisfied." In vain did they venture to
urge that liberty, equality, and all the rest of it, had been the purpose
they had in view, for he replied that " they were all equally bound
to show subservience to him, and that as to liberty, they were at
perfect liberty to do, say, or think anything that would not be
offensive to him, their master." He followed up this announcement
by placing a guard at the door of the Parliament, whose duty it was
to exclaim to each member, "You can't go in, sir, until you have
signed this paper," and on its being produced, it turned out to be
an agreement not to question in any manner Cromwell's authority.
Though this was a piece of tyranny and impertinence more
disgusting than anything that had been attempted by Charles, 130 of the
members yielded to it at once; for it is a curious fact that, though
the people will often show the susceptibility of the blood-horse at the
slightest check of the rein when it is held by a royal hand, they will
manifest the stolid patience of the ass under the most violent
treatment from one of themselves, who has risen to the position of
their master.


On the 14th of September Cromwell's door-keepers played their
parts so well, and barred the entrance so effectually against all but
those who would sign the paper, that a great many more agreed to
do so, and when the number of consenting parties was sufficiently
respectable to make up a fair average House, Cromwell's creatures
proceeded to vote that subscribing the recognition of the Protector
should be a necessary preliminary to taking a seat in Parliament.


The Protector having done everything he could for himself,
proceeded to show his protecting influence—of course—over several of
his relatives. Fleetwood, who had married his daughter—the widow
of Ireton,—was sent as governor to Ireland, and the Protector's own
son afterwards succeeded to this high and lucrative office. Not only
did he provide snugly for his living kindred, but he gave them most
inappropriate honours when dead, and his mother happening to go
off about this time, he actually insisted on the " old woman's" being
entombed in the Abbey of Westminster. What the dowager Mrs.
Cromwell had done to deserve this distinction, we have yet to learn,
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 257 -->
and as we have learnt everything connected with the subject on
which we write, our instruction on this point will, we fear, be
postponed to a very distant period.


Among the incidents of the Protector's domestic life, there is one
which we will insert on account of its amusing and perhaps
instructive character. Cromwell's vanity had so increased with his success,
that he one day said to himself, " I can drive a whole people; I can
drive a bargain as well as any man; and, odds, bobs, and buttercups!
why should I not be able to drive my own carriage ?" The cattle
having been put to, he mounted the box with a jaunty air to enjoy a
jaunt, and was tooling the cattle down Tooley Street, when, in
consequence of the friskiness of one of the nags, Cromwell began
nagging at his mouth with much violence. The horses not being so
easily guided and controlled as the Parliament, soon turned restive,
and ran away; which threw the Protector from his seat, and his own
poll came into collision with the pole of his carriage. To add to the
unpleasantness of the situation, a loaded pistol, which Cromwell
always carried about him, went off, in sympathy, no doubt, with
the steeds: or, perhaps, the charge could no longer contain itself,
and exploded with a burst of indignation at the pride of its owner,
who, however, was not wounded by the accident.


The Protector continued to feather his nest with unabated zeal,
and he got the Parliament to vote him half-a-dozen different abodes,
including three or four in London itself; so that, unless he took
breakfast at one, dined at a second, and took "his tea" at a third,
he could not have occupied the metropolitan residences set apart for
him. Multiplicity of lodgings appears to have been a.faiblesse of the
Protector: for, notwithstanding these six places of sojourn, there is
scarcely a suburb that has not a house or apartments to let that,
according to a landlord's myth, once served for the palace or
residence of Cromwell.


If we may trust to tradition, he once lived at a surgeon's in the
Broadway, Hammersmith; once in a lane at Brompton; once in
Little Upper James Street, North; and once in or near Piebald Row
on the confines of Pimlico. Having got an allotment of plenty of  
  
  
  VOL. II. L L
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 258 -->
houses, to an extent reminding us of the extravagant order of " some
more gigs " which an anonymous spendthrift once commanded of his
coachmaker, Cromwell began to think about getting a grant to pay
the expenses of his numerous establishments.


An allowance of £200,000 a year was settled on himself and his
successors, which, we find from a (*) document of the period, was
exactly one entire sixth of the whole aggregate revenue of the three
kingdoms put together.


Thus, though poor Charles had experienced the utmost difficulty
in getting money granted for the payment of his debts, or even for
the costs of his living like a king and a gentleman, the usurper
Cromwell obtained at once the concession of a most liberal salary.


Notwithstanding the subservience the Parliament had in the first
instance shown, symptoms of refractoriness in that quarter soon
became visible. The Protector had made up his mind to go on
changing it, as he would have done a set of domestic servants, until
he could thoroughly suit himself; and accordingly, on the 22nd of
January, 1656, he rang the bell, desired the legislature to appear
before him, and announced that he had no further use for it. The
members were desired to find themselves situations elsewhere; and
though some of them had courage enough to hint that they " would
be sure to better themselves, for they were tired of the quantity
of dirty work they had had to do," the Parliament evinced, on
the whole, a spirit, or rather a want of spirit, that was quite
contemptible. Some of the malcontents ventured on a little
revolutionary rising; but the levellers were speedily reduced to
their old level.


Major Wildman, a man rendered wild at the success of
Cromwell's ambition, and hating the Protectorate, had been heard to
declare that he would "take the linch-pin out of the common-weal,"
and notwithstanding the flaw in the orthography, he was imprisoned
on this evidence of hostility to the ruling power. At the moment
when Wildman was arrested, he was sitting alone in his ownback* Statement of a sub-committee of the Commons.
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 259 -->
parlour, evincing the same sort of enthusiasm that has immortalised
the three tailors of Tooley Street, and drawing up " a declaration of
the free and well-affected people of England now in arms against
the tyrant Oliver Cromwell, Esquire." The Major thought he had
accomplished something very stinging, in adding "Esquire" to  
  
  
  Arrest of Wlldman.

Cromwell's name; and he was in the act of roaring out, " Hear, hear!
Bravo, bravo!" after he had written out the title of his tremendous
manifesto, when a sudden bursting open of the door, and a cry of
"You must come along with us," threw the Major into a state of
surprise from which he had not recovered when he found himself put
for safe keeping in the keep of Chepstowe Castle. A few other
insurrectionary movements were made, but all of them were of a very
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P291_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 260 -->
trifling character. Penruddock, Grove, and Lucas got up a little
royalist trio, but their movement was soon turned into a
disconcerted piece, by a regiment of Cromwell's horse, who rode
roughshod over the three conspirators, and they were executed instead
of their project.


The Protector was no less imperious towards foreign nations than
towards his own, and having made some demands upon Spain, to
which that country refused to accede, he sent Admiral Penn,
familiarly termed his Nibs, to write his name upon some of the
Spanish possessions. Assisted by General Venables, Penn, who
may be distinguished as a steel-pen, for he carried a pointed sword,
and never showed a white feather, took the island of Jamaica after
a contest, in which he found among the inhabitants of Jamaica
some rum customers. Blake worried the Spaniards in another
quarter, and the Protector spread so much consternation among
some of the European governments, that the celebrated Cardinal
Mazarin, who greatly feared him, began to look so very blue, that a
Mazarine blue retains to this very day a character for intensity.


Emboldened by his good fortune, Cromwell thought he might
venture on another parliament, which met on the 17th of September,
1656, the members having undergone at the door an examination
as to their servility to the Protector's purposes. The first sitting
was like the first night of any novelty at the pit of Her Majesty's
Theatre, and two of Cromwell's creatures officiated as check-takers.
Every member who presented himself at the doors was obliged to
produce his credentials, and upon this being satisfactorily done, a
cry of " Pass one " was raised to the officer in charge of the inner
barrier. Nearly one hundred new members were sent back, after
more or less altercation; and the words " I can't help it, sir; those
are my orders; you must go back, sir," were being continually
heard above the din of " Pass one," or " It's all right," which
confirmed the privilege of admission claimed by many of the applicants.


A legislature with only one house soon began to be considered
as a sort of sow with one ear, and even the ear that remained was
closed by Cromwell's art against what he used to call in private
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 261 -->
"the swinish multitude." A suggestion was made by several that
the House of Lords should be restored, and many began to sigh for a
return to the old constitution, which had been broken up before there
had been time to try the effect of a new one.


At length an alderman of London, one Sir Christopher Pack,
started up, without any preliminary notice, and moved that the title
of king should be offered to the Protector. Pack's proposition set off
the entire pack of republicans in full cry against him, and they all
continued to give tongue from the 23rd of February to the 26th of
March, 1657, when Pack's motion was carried by a large majority.
A deputation was appointed to request that " his Highness would be
pleased to magnify himself with the title of king,"—a proposition
almost as absurd as an offer to place Barclay and Perkins on the
throne, or entreat Meux and Co. to write Henry IX. over the door
of their brewery.


Cromwell gave an evasive reply to the requisition, approving
most fully of the proposition to restore the House of Lords, but was
hanging back about the " other little matter," when a declaration
from some of his former friends and tools, that they had fought
against monarchy and would do so again if required, completely
settled him in his wavering refusal of the royal title. He was
therefore inaugurated with much pomp as Lord Protector, and indeed
he might well have been satisfied, for he had secured everything
except the name of royalty.


His manner of life and his court were marked by no extravagant
show, but he had everything very comfortable; and he was
accustomed to say to his intimate friends, " What do I want with the gilt,
for haven't I got the gingerbread?" He did not give very large
parties at Hampton Court, but used to have " a few friends " to tea,
and " a little music " in the evening. He occasionally attempted a
joke, " but this," says Whitelock, " was always a very ponderous
business." One of his frolics—we start instinctively at the idea of
Cromwell being frolicsome — was to order a drum to beat in the
middle of dinner, falling unpleasantly on the drums of his guests'
ears, and at the signal the Protector's guards were allowed to rush
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 262 -->
into the room, clear the table, pocket the poultry, and, on a certain
signal from the drum, make off with the drumsticks.

Cromwell had the good taste to delight in the society of clever
men, and there was always a knife and fork at Hampton Court for  
  
  
  
One of ths Protector's Tea Parties.  
  
  
  Milton, or for that marvel of his age, the celebrated Andrew Marvel

Waller, the poet, was welcome always; Dryden now and then; John
Biddle sometimes; and Archbishop Usher, whom Cromwell used to
call the only real Gentleman Usher of his day, was constantly kicking
his heels under the Protector's mahogany.

<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 263 -->

We have now to record the death of poor Blake, who, having
fluttered the Canaries in the isles of that name, was returning safe
into Plymouth Sound, when he died of the scurvy, which, according
to a wag of that day—happily the wretch is not a wag of this—
showed that Fortune had in store for him but scurvy treatment.
Poor Blake had been in early life a candidate for an Oxford
fellowship, but lost it from the lowness of his stature,* for in Blake's time
very little fellows were not academically recognised. There is no
doubt that with his general ability he would have taken a very high
degree if he had been only big enough. He was buried at the
Protector's expense, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, for Cromwell was
a great undertaker, and was very fond of providing his friends with
splendid funerals.


While these things were happening at home, the Protector was
fortifying his position abroad, and had persuaded the French to
abandon Charles II., known to the world in general, and to
playgoers in particular, as the " merry monarch." This fugitive scamp—
of whom more hereafter—was mean enough to offer to marry one of
the Misses Cromwell, a daughter of the usurper, who had the good
sense and spirit to turn up his puritanical nose at the idea of such a
son-in-law. Orrery, whom Charles consulted with the vague idea
that consulting an orrery was in fact consulting the stars, took the
message to Cromwell, who replied haughtily, " I am more than a
match for Charles, but Charles is less than a match for my daughter."


The Protector had what he called something better in view for his
\"gal," who, on the 17th of November, was wedded to Lord
Falconbridge. The ceremony was described in the Morning Post of the
period, which was then called the Court Gazette, and a column was
devoted to an account of the festivities. We see from facts like these
how ready are the declaimers against aristocracy to adopt the ways
and even the weaknesses of a class that is ridiculed and abused chiefly
by those who would, if they could, belong to it.  
  
  
  The ascendency of the puritan Protector was marked by the  
  
  
  * Brodie, Brit. Emp., iv. 317.
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 264 -->
grossest corruption that ever prevailed under the most licentious of
regal governments. Unlimited bribery of one portion of the people
was effected by the unlimited robbery of the other, and thus the
dupes were made to pay the knaves who sold themselves and
betrayed their fellow-subjects for the sake of Cromwell's
aggrandisement.  
  
  
  On the 20th of January, 1658, the Parliament met again, and  
  
  
  One, Two, Three, and Under.

fraternised with a little batch of peers, amounting to sixty in all,
whom Cromwell had created, and who might, indeed—upon our
honour, we don't say so for the sake of the pun—be justly called his
creatures. Two of the Protector's sons, namely, Richard and Henry,
were among the batch of anything but thoroughbreds, that formed
the roll of Oliver's peerage.


The number, however, included some highly respectable names,
among whom we may particularly notice Lord Mulgrave, who took
the family name of Phipps, because in the civil wars he would not at
one time have given Phippence for his life; Lord John Claypole,
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P296_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 265 -->
whose head was as thick and whose brains were as muddy as his
title implies; and a few old military friends of Cromwell. Colonel
Pride, who had been a drayman, was also among the new peers; and
the drayman of course offered a fair butt to the royalists, who threw
his dray in his face and assailed him with the shafts of ridicule.


Scarcely any of the genuine nobles who had been called to
Parliament condescended to come, and the Protector made his appearance
before a house almost as poor as some of those in which the farce ot
legislation is enacted in these days at nearly the close of a very long
session. Cromwell was really indisposed, or shammed indisposition
on account of the scantiness of the audience, for, after having said a
few words, he turned to his Lord Speaker Fiennes, exclaiming,
\"Fiennes! you know my mind pretty well; so just give it them as
strongly as you like, for I'm too tired to talk to them." Fiennes,
taking the hint, proceeded to rattle on at a very rapid rate, mixing
up a quantity of religious quotations and a vast deal of vulgar abuse,
in the prevailing style of the period.


The Commons retired to their chamber in a huff; and, four days
afterwards receiving a message mentioning the Upper House, refused
to recognise the peers except as the " other house,"—for the little
Shakspearean fable of the Rose, the Odour, and the Name, was not
at that time popular. The Protector, who always sent for the
Parliament as he would have sent for his tailor, desired that the legislature
should be shown into the banquetting or dining-room, where he
advised them not to quarrel, and, producing the public accounts, he
impressed upon them that things were very bad in the City. He
exhorted them not to increase the panic by any dissensions among
themselves, but he could not persuade them to change their note;
and he accordingly got out of bed—some say, wrong leg first—
very early on the 4th of February, when, calling for his hot water
and his Parliament, he dissolved the latter without a moment's
warning. The legislative body had enjoyed a short but not very
merry life of fourteen days, when an end was thus put to its too
weak existence.  
  
  
  The Protector was now in need of all his protective powers in

consequence of the dangers that on all sides threatened him. The
republicans were ready, as they generally are, to draw anything,
from a sword to a bill; and the army, with its pay in arrear, did
nothing but grumble. The royalists were being inspirited by the
Marquis of Ormond, who was " up in town," quite incog.; and the
levellers were, of course, ready to sink to any level, however
degraded, in the cause of the first leader who was willing and able to
purchase them.


Notwithstanding the gathering storm, Cromwell boldly stuck up
the sword of vengeance by his side, as a sort of lightning conductor to
turn aside the destruction that threatened him. A pamphlet, called
\"Killing no Murder," put him to the expense of a steel shirt, the
collar of which, by the way, could have required no starch; and he
kept himself continually " armed in proof," but we do not know
whether he selected an author's proof, which might have been truly
impregnable armour, for getting through an author's proof is
frequently quite impossible. He carried pistols in his pockets, to be let
off when occasion required—a provision of which he never gave his
enemies the benefit. Poor Dr. Hunt was cruelly cut off—or, at least,
his head was—which amounted to much the same thing; and others
were treated with similar severity.


On the Continent the Protector was very successful, and the
English serving under Turenne, or, as some have called him, Tureen,
poured down upon Dunkirk, which was overwhelmed and taken.
Cromwell, however, lived a miserable life at home, being suspicious
of every one about him, and he never dared sleep more than two
consecutive nights in the same place—a circumstance that may
account for the multiplicity of lodgings we have already alluded to.
This continual changing of apartments must have rendered him very
liable to get put into damp sheets, and, as hydropathy had not yet
been reduced to a system, he caught the ague, instead of profiting by
the moisture of the bed-clothes.


On the 2nd of September he grew very bad indeed, and, in the
presence of four or five of the Council, he named his son Richard
to succeed him; but this youth was so complete a failure, that
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 267 -->
to talk of his succeeding was utterly ridiculous. Oliver Cromwell
died between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of
September, the day on which he always expected good luck, for it
was the anniversary of some of his greatest victories. Death,
however, is an enemy not to be overcome, and, in spite of the prestige
of success which belonged to the day, the Protector was compelled
to yield to the universal conqueror. He died in the fifty-ninth year  
  
  
  Cromwell-playing at Leap-frog with his Children.

of his age, and it is a singular coincidence that Nature brewed a
tremendous storm—as if in compliment to the brewer—at the very
moment of his dissolution.


The character of Cromwell was, as we have already intimated, a
species of half-and-half, in which the smaller description of beer
appeared to preponderate. He had, like a pot of porter, a good
head; but, to draw a simile from the same refreshing fount, he was
rather frothy than substantial in his political qualities. His speeches
had the wonderful peculiarity of meaning nothing, and instead of
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P299_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 268 -->
saying a great deal in a few words, he managed to say very little in
a great many.*


Cromwell wrote almost as obscurely as he spoke, and he could
do little more than sign his name, for which he used to make the
old excuse of the illiterate, that his education had been somewhat
neglected; and indeed it seemed to have gone very little beyond
those primitive pothooks intended for the hanging up of future
more important acquisitions. The Protector's wit was
exceedingly coarse, or rather particularly fine, for it was scarcely
perceptible. It savoured much of the Scotch humorist, whose fun
might be exceedingly good sometimes, if it were not always
invisible. His practical jokes were not particularly happy, and his
smearing the chairs with sweetmeats at Whitehall, to dirty the
dresses of the ladies, was a piece of facetiousness worthy of an
eccentric scavenger, but highly unbecoming to the chief magistrate,
for the time being, of such a country as England.


Though Cromwell could scarcely read the characters of
caligraphy, he could peruse the characters of men with great acuteness.
He was well acquainted with all the variations of human types, and
could easily distinguish the capitals from the lower-case. In private
life he was playful, though in his public capacity he was severe even
to cruelty; and it has hence been prettily remarked, that, though he
was a kitten in the bosom of his family, the puss became a tiger in
the arena of politics. He never turned his back upon any of his
children, except at leap-frog, in which he would often indulge with
his sons, who had little of that vaulting ambition for which their
parent was conspicuous.


* The following is an extract from one of the Protector's speeches, which even
Captain Bunsby, the naval oracle in Dombey aud Son, might be proud of:—"I
confess, I would say, I hope, I may be understood in this, for indeed I must be tender in
what I say to such an audience as this;—I say, I would be understood that in this
argument I do not make a parallel between men of a different mind."—Original

the new Protector, as they would upon Brown, Jones, Robinson, or
any other piece of scum that the tide of chance might have thrown
up to the same position. There was the usual junction of
condolence on the death of the parent, and joy at the accession of the
son; but both expressions were equally affected and hypocritical.
Richard Cromwell was, however, such a mere nonentity, that he could
not turn to account the advantages of his position : and when the army
promised to stand by him to a man he had nothing to say beyond
\"Dear me! how very kind of the army!" He had, it is true, been
born, as the saying is, " with a silver spoon in his mouth," and the
qualities of the spoon had become incorporated with his being.


The soldiers soon began to discover that the brewer's son knew
more about barrels of beer than barrels of gunpowder, and that his
acquaintance with the musket was limited to the butt end of it. A
petition was got up among the troops requesting him to resign; but
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P301_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 270 -->
he replied, that though he was very willing to do anything to oblige,
he was sure his people did not wish him to relinquish the command
of the army.


Richard had sent, as usual, for the coffers of the state, which
have been generally the first object of solicitude to one attaining the
post of chief magistrate. Some small change was all that the coffers
contained, and he resolved to call a Parliament in order to replenish
them. The legislative Assembly met on the 27th of January, 1659,
but was very soon torn by factions of every sort, except satisfaction,
which there were no symptoms of in any quarter whatever.
Fleetwood, the brother-in-law of Richard Cromwell, and Desborough, his
uncle-in-law, who had married his aunt, got up a movement against
him among the soldiers, who resented their want of pay, and avowed
their determination not to draw their swords until they had drawn
their salaries. Finding there was nothing to be got out of the
Parliament, Richard dissolved it, and the old one that Oliver had
forcibly ejected had the impudence to resume its sittings. The new
Protector beginning to think, like his father, that self-protection was
the first duty he had to perform, withdrew to Hampton Court, and
sent in his resignation, which was accepted immediately.


The Parliament, though very long of date, was very short of cash,
and coolly proposed selling the three royal palaces to ease the
pecuniary pressure which the tightness in the City was occasioning.
Royalist plots, however, disturbed the plans of the Assembly, whose
members quarrelled fiercely with each other, and were terribly
bamboozled by Monk, who had a large amount of monkish deception
in his character. He wrote letters to cajole Parliament, while he
was in treaty with the king; but the former, being very short of
cash, soon decided, whatever doubts he might have entertained as to
which was the best investment for his allegiance.


It having become tolerably sure that Charles II. would be sent
for, there was a sudden rush of competitors for the honour or
dishonour, as the case may be, of bringing him back to England.
Even Fleetwood, the brother-in-law of Richard Cromwell, and the
sonin-law of Oliver, was on the point of undertaking the job; but having
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 271 -->
entered into a sort of tacit agreement with Lambert, to give him a
share in any job that he (Fleetwood) might undertake, the latter could
not make up his mind to sell himself in the former's absence.


Monk continued to deceive the Parliament with so much success
that he was invited by that body to come to London, and accept the
situation of keeper of St. James's Park, a post of honour rather than
of active duty : for, in those days, " the boys " had not gained such
ascendency as to call for activity in the metropolitan beadlery.
Monk used his new position for the purpose of promoting the object
for the furtherance of which he had in fact sold himself to the king;
and his Majesty having sent a letter to the Parliament, in which the
lords had again mustered very strong, a favourable answer was
returned to it.


Charles was voted a sum of £50,000 to pay his expenses home,
and the evening was spent in bell-ringing, beer, and bonfires.
Royalty rushed up to a premium as exorbitant and unhealthy as the
discount to which it had fallen in the days of the Commonwealth;
and on the 8th of May, 1660, Charles was proclaimed at the gate of
Westminster Hall, amidst loud cries of "Hats off!" "Down in
front! " " Long live the king ! " and " Where are you shoving to ?"


Richard Cromwell made himself not the least obstacle to any
arrangements that might be made for deposing him, and indeed begged
the parties concerned would not " consider him " in any alterations
that circumstances might require. His chief anxiety was to get a
guarantee against the expenses of his father's funeral, for which "poor
Richard" feared he was legally responsible. He sneaked eventually
out of the kingdom, and making a call abroad on a foreign prince,
who did not know him, was told to his face, in the course of casual
conversation, that " Oliver Cromwell, though a villain and a traitor,
was fit to command, but that Richard was a mere poltroon and an
idiot.* " What has become of the fellow ? " added the prince; upon
which Richard suddenly withdrew, and the conversation ended. He

eventually returned to England, and taking the name of Clark, died
unknown at a little place in Cheshunt.


We may as well finish off the Cromwells at once, while we are
about them, by mentioning that the last known descendant of the
family, who died in 1821, was on the roll of attornies. From the
throne of England to the stool in a solicitor's office, is undoubtedly a
dreadful drop; and if Oliver Cromwell could have seen the last of his
race making out a bill of costs, the Protector would have received a
lesson by which he might have profited.

  HAT improvement was not
stationary during the period we
have just been describing, will be
inferred from the fact that, in 1625,
Science called a hackney-coach into
existence. Though in these days,
invention would seem to be at a
stand if it went no further than the
point we have indicated, still the
hackney-carriage was a decided
advance on the slow coaches of
previous centuries. From a print of

exhibited a sort of combination of the 'bus and the boiler. The
hackney coachmen did not long enjoy a monopoly, for in 1634,
Sir Sanders Duncomb thrust a pair of poles through an old
sentrybox, and calling it a sedan, started it as a "turn out" for his own
convenience. The arrangement seeming to give satisfaction, he
obtained a patent for fourteen in all, and S. D. advertised the careful
removal of ladies and gentlemen by means of his new invention.


In the year 1630, London began to exhibit symptoms of
outgrowing its strength, and fresh buildings within three miles of the
gates were prohibited. So long as the metropolis extended on all
sides alike, there could have been nothing to fear, for it would have
been as broad as it was long, at any rate. It is a curious fact, that
those persons who had money in the 16th and 17 th centuries, did
not know what to do with it. They had been in the habit of keeping
it in the Royal Mint, till Charles the First got into the ugly habit of
going down to that establishment, clearing off the whole of the cash
it contained, calling it a loan, and never paying it back again. The
capitalists next tried the experiment of lodging their cash with their
clerks and apprentices, and unfortunately it soon became current coin
of the realm, for the clerks and apprentices all ran away with it.
\"The moneyed men, listening at last," says Anderson, " to these
admoney—tory lessons, began to place their cash in the hands of
goldsmiths," but these gentlemen used to pick out the heaviest
coins, and make a profit by the sweating process, so that instead of
living by the sweat of their own brows, they lived by the sweating of
other people's money. This was the origin of the banking business,
which began in, or near, Sweeting's Alley, then called Sweating's
Alley, from the practices we have mentioned.


Gardening industry made wonderfully rapid strides during this era*
for the peas were well drilled, the cabbages made to stand at ease in
the open air, and the turnips to take close order, at the
commencement of the seventeenth century. Cherries soon after came amongst
the English people, with a degree of cherry bounce that the beauty
and delicacy of the fruit perhaps warranted. The apple was
welcomed with enthusiasm, and Samuel Hartlib, a gardener of the day
—week, month, or year, was so affected by the flourishing growth  
  
  
  VOL. II. N N
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 274 -->
of an apple tree he had planted, that the well-known expression,
\"Go it, my pippin," burst from his lips, and has taken its place in
popularity with the Eureka of the old philosopher. The hops also
presented themselves as candidates for British favour, and were soon
at the top of the poll in all directions.


The woollen manufactures of England acquired importance at a
very early date; but the secret of dyeing the cloth could never be
discovered, and every failure only threw a wretched stain upon
national ingenuity. At length a Dutchman settled himself, in 1643,
at Bow, and announced, by a notice in his bow-window, his intention
to get a living by dyeing upon an entirely new principle. Hitherto
the English had miserably failed in this branch of art, for when they
attempted to master the dye, and keep it under their control, it was
always sure to come off with flying colours. The Dutchman of Bow
had determined to conquer, even in dyeing, and he not only
succeeded in producing a single shade, but he made such hits with his
shots, that customers might safely stand the hazard of the dye, if they
brought their orders to his establishment. He taught the art to the
English, the fastness of whose colours had been previously shown in
the extreme rapidity of their running.


In 1622, hemp and flax having been introduced, ready dressed,
into this country, the rope manufacture twined itself with the
industrial institutions of England. There had been always a
prejudice against the use of coal for domestic purposes; but on its
value in manufactures being discovered, it acquired a higher
character, though its best friends were never able to say that coal
after all is not so black as it had been painted. It was extensively
employed in iron manufactories, which had greatly advanced; and
we have seen an old woodcut of a saw which is one of those very
"wise saws" that may be considered equal to the best of our
"modern instances."


Knowing the danger of playing with edge tools, we forbear to
speak of them any longer in a sportive strain, and turn to the state
of music in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Henry VIII,
himself was a composer, if we are to believe Sir John Hawkins, but
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 275 -->
we suspect that the monarch's well-known overtures to the Pope may
have misled the musical historian. There were several writers of
madrigals, a class of production whose name has been ingeniously
but ignorantly supposed to have reference to the mad wriggles into
which the music throws itself.


Charles I. was an adept in the pleasing science, and pretended to
play on the viol, though not without a sad viol—ation of some of
the rules of harmony. He was, however, fond of melody, which,
like everything else of a cheerful and agreeable nature, received a
sad blow from the dull puritanical humbugs who rose into importance
at the time of the Commonwealth. These psalm-singing sycophants
were so fond of hearing their own melancholy and monotonous
voices, that no accompaniments were allowed : and thus, to use the
impassioned pun of Smith,* " one of the most disgusting specimens
of an organised hypocrisy that the world ever saw was carried on
entirely without the use of organs."


The Fine Arts flourished in England under Charles I., who was
a scholar, a man of taste, a gentleman, and, in fact, everything but
what he ought to have been—namely, a good sovereign. He
employed Vandyke to take off his head, or rather multiply it frequently,
as if he felt a foreboding of his eventually losing it. He was also
the patron of Inigo Jones, the architect of several public buildings,
and of his own fortune.


The Drama is a subject so exciting to antiquarian speculation,
that we are afraid of losing ourselves in the mists of ages by plunging
into it. We cannot hope to surpass in sagacity some of those
ingenious annotators of the present day, who have had such a keen
eye to Gammer Gurton's needle, that they actually trace its existence
to so remote a date as some few years before the birth of its author, f
We need not particularise the various dramatic authors who gave
lustre to the Elizabethan period, nor shall we fall into the affectation
of talking about Master Beaumont, Master Fletcher, Master Jonson,
Master Shakspeare, Master Deekes, and Master Heywood, as if they

had been so many precocious young gentlemen or juvenile prodigies
of which the present age is somewhat prodigal.


The Long Parliament put down all stage plays, for the miserable
mummers of whom that assembly was composed were desirous of
having all the acting to themselves, though they made a very poor
burlesque of the parts of statesmen and patriots. It has beeninThe Balance of Power

geniously suggested by Mr. Collier, in his History of Dramatic Poetry,
that the Puritanical Parliament suppressed the drama and dramatists
less on conscientious grounds than from the fear of being made the
subject of well-merited satire. The same feeling which would urge
a legislature of pickpockets to abolish the police might have actuated
the republicans in their zeal to get rid of that moral watch which a
well-regulated state will always keep over cant and villainy.


If, however, dramatic performances were scarce during the
ascendency of Cromwell and the Puritans, the public—had they known how
to appreciate it—would not have been without food for mirth in the
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P308_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 277 -->
very ludicrous exhibitions which the events of the day were
perpetually furnishing. The career of Cromwell himself might have
suggested an amusing spectacle to those who are in the habit of
turning to the ridiculous side of everything. A brewer on the
throne, endeavouring to unite republican simplicity with royal state,
presents to the imagination a figure almost as grotesque as that of
an elephant on the tight-rope—an idea in which there is that rare
combination of ponderosity and levity, which Cromwell's conduct on
the protectoral elbow, or supreme armchair, will be found to have
realised. His unwieldy gambols and great preponderance over all
below him, were most fatal to that balance of power which can never
be sustained without an equality of pressure and an equality of
resistance on all sides.


Our survey of the literature of the 17th century would be
incomplete if we were to omit to notice the 3rd of November, 1640, as
being the date of the earliest English newspaper. It bore the name
of the " Diurnal Occurrences; or, Daily Proceedings of both Houses,"
but though it professed to give daily news, it was only a weekly
periodical. There arose rapidly a provincial press, but its
pretensions were slight, and " News from Hull," " Truths from York,"
\"Warranted Tidings from Ireland," were the names of some of
the chief of these country newspapers. Their leading articles
were not much in the style we are accustomed to at the present
day; but the ancient order of penny-a-liners seemed to be ever
agog for these precocious gooseberries, showers of frogs, and
fading reminiscences of oldest inhabitants, that are still the staple
of the productions of this humble class of contributors. It is a
remarkable coincidence that the circulation of the blood and the
circulation of newspapers should both have belonged to this period
of our country's history.


Furniture and costume improved wonderfully in this age, and the
wealthy became less chary of expense in their chairs, while they began
to sleep on down, or, in other words, to feather their nests with great
luxuriance. The clothes of the times of the two Charles's were made
much too large for the wearers, and may be considered characteristic
of the loose habits of the period. The hair was cut short by the
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 278 -->
republican party, or Roundheads, in memory of whom the culprits at
Clerkenwell and other prisons are cropped exceedingly close, though
this is not the only point of resemblance between the modern rogues
and the old regicides.


The condition of the people was not very enviable in the era
we have described, and it is a remarkable as well as a most
instructive fact, that common-wealth is usually synonymous with
common poverty. Wages were invariably low, for a man-servant
who could thrash a corn-field and kill a hog, received only fifty
shillings per annum. Poverty and knavery, begging and filching,
were at their height under the reign of the Puritans; for "Like
master, like man," was at all times a proverb that could be
thoroughly relied upon.

is an anecdote connected with his escape from Worcester, which
we have not given before, because, as it rests chiefly on the
authority of the " Merry Monarch " himself, the story is very likely
to be dubious.


Whether fact or fiction, we may give it a place in the history of
his reign, for if the tale is made up, the manufacture is entirely his
own, and so far may be considered to belong to his annals. We
shall therefore follow the thread of the king's own narrative, and
if the yarn he has spun was of a fabricated fabric, it is to Charles
and not to us that the imposture must be attributed.


On the battle of Worcester being utterly lost, Charles began to
think of saving himself; but his adherents, who had been thoroughly
beaten, insisted on sticking to him with rather inconvenient loyalty.

<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 282 -->
Feeling that a small party could run away much faster than a large
one, he resolved to give his too faithful friends the slip; and when
night came on he succeeded in doing so, leaving his supporters, who
would have stuck to him till death, to shift for themselves. Charles,
with that scamp Wilmot, afterwards Rochester, and three or four
others, got clean off in a very dirty manner. Some advised the king
to take shelter among the Scotch; but his Majesty, having no desire
to be regularly sold, declined putting himself in the power of a
people who at that time valued the virtues for exactly what they
might bring, and would no doubt have received the king with open
arms as an eligible investment to be speedily realised. He
determined, therefore, to proceed towards London, and, by the aid of a
leathern doublet, grey breeches, and green jerkin, he " made up "
very effectually as a stage countryman.


Taking with him a real countryman, one Richard Penderell, as a
companion, Charles went into a wood, from the edge of which he saw
a troop of horse; but the rain poured down in such torrents that the
troop retired, instead of taking shelter in the wood, which was
certainly the wisest course they could have adopted. The anecdote
is, however, so essentially dramatic, that the soldiers were perfectly
in character when they went quite in the opposite direction to that
they should have taken, like those pursuers on the stage who usually
overlook the person they are in search of, and who, to every one else,
is most conspicuously visible.


Charles's position on this occasion resembled, in a minor degree,
the situation of the fugitive at the fair, who, pointing to a painted
blind representing a tree with a hole cut down the centre of it,
expressed his determination to conceal himself in " yonder thicket."
Finding accommodation only for his body in the tree's imaginary
trunk, his legs of course protruded from the " shady grove,"
when two assassins in hot pursuit tumbling over the out-hanging
heels of the wretched runaway, exclaimed confidentially in the ears
of the audience, " By ivins, he as eluded us! " Such must have been
the good fortune of Charles, and the stupid blindness of the troop,
when the former sat on the forest's edge, and the latter never
noted him.
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 283 -->

This incident being over, another soon afterwards ensued of an
equally melodramatic character. Charles and Penderell, after
travelling two nights on foot, had put up at the house of one of Penderell's
brothers; but it was not thought safe to remain in it, and his
Majesty was recommended to an oak, whose parent stem would

afford friendly shelter, while all the junior branches might be
thoroughly relied upon. The king having supplied himself with
bread, cheese, and beer, which could not have been table beer, for
there was no table to put it on—though there were plenty of leaves
—made the best of the imperfect accommodation that the tree
afforded him. He had no sooner settled on his perch, and made
himself a kind of nest in the boughs, than some soldiers entered on
the O. P. side, and looked everywhere—except in the right place—■
for the fugitive monarch. His legs, as usual, were visible enough,
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P315_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 284 -->
but the troopers possibly mistook them for a pair of stockings
hanging up to dry, and they were not even struck by the shoes at the end,
that should have awakened them to the value of the booty. The
most infantine participators in the game of Hide and Seek, would
not have been at fault under circumstances of a similar kind; and
there can scarcely be a doubt, that if any urchin had only raised a
suggestive cry of " Hot beans and butter ! " Charles would have been
laid by the heels without a scruple on the part of those who were in
search of him.


Leaving his Majesty's legs to dangle in the air, and allowing
credulity to score one for his heels on the cribbage-board of fancy, we
proceed to contemplate Charles in a more dignified position on the
throne of England. He arrived at Dover on the 25th of May, with
his two little brothers, who had grown to men, but were still called
\"the boys " by those who remembered them before their exile from
the land of their forefathers. Monk received the royal trio, who rode
to the hotel in the same hackney-coach with the general, forgetting
that there had been a good deal of truly monkish cunning in the
conduct of that individual, who being the latest with his service,
obtained the favour due to much earlier and older royalists.


The principle of " First come, first served," was in this instance
laid aside, and the rule of " last come, served best," was ungratefully
adopted. A most unreasonable reaction towards royalty now ensued,
and the anxiety to deal mercilessly with the regicides ran into a
most sanguinary extreme, surpassing in fury the most blood-thirsty
predilections of the fiercest republicans.


Both Houses of Parliament met, and an Act of Indemnity was
passed for the benefit of the king's enemies; but, like the old story
of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark, most of the persons
interested in the Act were excepted from its provisions. Nineteen of the
regicides surrendered; and ten more being in custody, formed a
batch of twenty-nine to be brought to trial. A commission was
issued for the purpose, and on the 9th of October, 1660, the
proceedings began before a tribunal of thirty-four, many of whom had
been Long-Parliament Men, masked Presbyterians, or miscellaneous

scamps, of quite as revolutionary a turn as some of the prisoners
submitted to their judgment. Sir Hardress Waller, who was number
one on the list, had prepared a very fine speech in his defence; but
looking over the document, he made up his mind that it was rather
strong, and could certainly do no good, upon which he pleaded
guilty. Harrison and Carew, who came next, made each a very
eloquent and enthusiastic harangue, glorying in their respective acts,
by which they laid down their lives as an investment for a reversionary
interest in the good books of posterity.


Henry Marten, " the wit of the House of Commons," made a
most dismal attempt to laugh the matter off, and to joke the
prosecution out of court; but his humour, notwithstanding its
extreme heaviness, had no weight with his judges. He began by
demanding the benefit of the Act of Oblivion, and in a lame bon mot
claimed to be allowed to forget himself. He was sharply told he
must plead guilty or not guilty, but he insisted on the benefit of the
Act of Indemnity, saying his name did not appear among the
exceptions, and that in fact he had never been an exceptional
character. Irritated by these dismal jokes—so insulting to the
understanding of the court—the Solicitor-General ordered the Act
to be produced, with the name of Henry Marten inserted legibly
enough, when " the droll," with a miserable quibble not even
amounting to a pun, exclaimed, "My name is not so—it is Harry
Marten." This unmeaning objection being very properly overruled,
the " mad wag" endeavoured to stand upon his reputation for
mad waggery, and urged that being known as a wit, he had done
nothing with a serious intention. He was, however, told that
regicide in sport was high treason in earnest, when, after some few
further attempts at facetiousness, the " witty Harry Marten "
was found guilty, and retired cutting wretched jokes upon the
disgusted turnkey.


The court, which, in order to get beforehand with its work, had
prepared most of its verdicts before the trials commenced, had
already determined on fixing the act of cutting off the king's head on
the shoulders of William Hewlett. Everything went to prove that
the common hangman had performed the sanguinary job for thirty
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 286 -->
pounds, but the commissioners had made up their minds, and were
unwilling to open the very small parcels, for the purpose of looking
at the charge by the light of the evidence. Hewlett was condemned,
but people beginning to talk of the glaring injustice of the verdict,
he was eventually saved from capital punishment. Poor Garland
was another of the intended victims, and it may well be said that
Garland by his heroism has made himself a wreath of immortality.
He would have pleaded guilty to the accusation of having signed the
death-warrant of Charles, but indignantly repudiated the charge of
having insulted the fallen sovereign. " I was a regicide, it is true,"
exclaimed Garland, " but as for the assertion of my having been base
enough to spit in the face of the king, I throw it back in the face
of my enemies."


Upon this the Solicitor-General called as a witness a low, needy
fellow, named Clench, who swore not only to the spitting by Garland,
but to the king having wiped his face immediately afterwards; and
from the supplementary lie told by Clench to support the first
falsehood, the term Clencher obviously took its origin. Poor Garland
was found guilty, of course, but his life was not eventually forfeited.
The executions of the regicides were very numerous, and conducted
in a spirit of barbarous brutality, that excited a great deal of disgust
at the time among all but those who were animated by the desire to
retaliate the atrocities that the other side had committed. It is, in
fact, a very common fault among philanthropists, and others who rush
about with a strong sense of great social wrongs, to commit some
other wrongs equally great, or even greater, upon the persons by
whom their virtuous indignation may have been excited.


We feel naturally interested in the fate of poor Harry Marten,
the "funny-man" of the long Parliament. While in prison under
sentence of death, he was visited by some aristocratic friends, who
recommended the wit to petition in a jocose strain, but his humour
had become exceedingly dreary in his dingy dungeon. He
contrived, nevertheless, to serve up one small pun in a lengthy document
begging for mercy; and though the Commons did not see the fun of
the thing, the Lords good-naturedly took it for granted that, coming
from a professed wag, there must be " something in it," and with a
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 287 -->
patronising "Ha, ha!—very clever—amazingly droll!"—the Peers
remitted his sentence.


Though Royalty had risen wonderfully in public respect, there
was nothing in the conduct of the royal family to render it respectable.
The Queen-Mother, Henrietta Maria, returned to England with an
extensive French suite, and ran into debt even over her head and
ears, which being very long, may enable us to measure the depths of
her extravagance. The utmost dissoluteness prevailed at court, and
the king's brother, the Duke of York, had married—several months
later than he should have done—Miss Anne Hyde, the daughter of the
Lord Chancellor Clarendon. This consummate old humbug affected
to be much pained at the degradation of his prince, through his
marriage with Clarendon's own daughter, and the Chancellor,
affecting to doubt the fact, declared, if it were true, "The woman should
go to the Tower and have her head chopped off!" in accordance
with an Act of Parliament he would himself draw up for that purpose.
All this unnatural abuse of his own child, instead of earning him the
smallest respect, simply rendered him infamous in the minds of all
but those who believed he was acting a part, and who regarded
him, therefore, as simply contemptible. He is believed to have been
secretly engaged in promoting the marriage against which he
publicly protested; and the recognition of his daughter as Duchess
of York, which soon afterwards took place, was purchased, it is said,
by Clarendon's paying the debts of the Queen-Mother, by, of course,
robbing the people.


It is impossible to say much for the magnanimity of the royalist
party, whose triumph was signalised by continued acts of mingled
ferocity and littleness. A law was passed attainting Oliver
Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, who were dragged from their graves in
Westminster Abbey and hanged at Tyburn, on the 30th of January, the
day of the death of Charles I.—in celebration of his martyrdom. This
was certainly one way of crying quits with the regicides in the game
of butchery, and both sides were thus brought to the same degraded
level. The royalist resurrectionists having commenced the
desecration of the dead, did not relinquish their loathsome pursuit until they
had ex-humed, as we learn from Hume, the remains of Cromwell's
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 288 -->
highly-respectable mother and inoffensive daughter, as well as
numerous others who had done nothing in life to render them in death
the objects of enmity.


All parties now began to claim the merit of the Restoration in
the hope of obtaining a reward, and bills for old arrears of alleged
loyalty were sent in to the government. The Scotch were of course
not backward in looking after the profits due, or supposed to be due,
on account of any assistance rendered to Charles in his misfortunes;
but the king and his friends having been sold two or three times
over by the crafty Caledonians, his Majesty thought they had really
made their full money out of him. When, therefore, the Marquis of
Argyle asked permission to pay his respects, a friendly reply was
despatched to bring him up to town; but on his arrival at Whitehall,
he had scarcely knocked at the door when he found he was regularly
let in, for a guard tapping him on the shoulder, walked him off as a
traitor. He was sent to be tried by his own countrymen; for as
some of them would profit by his death, it was considered that
making them his judges would be a sure method of getting rid of
him. The result realised the estimate formed of the character of the
Scotch, who condemned him and hanged him as a matter of beesness,
because there was a small profit to be got out of the transaction.
Poor Argyle had been the very party who had put the crown on
the king's head a few years before, at Scone; but " Life," said
he, on the scaffold, " is a toss up, and it's heads I lose on this
melancholy occasion."


On the 8th of May, 1661, a new Parliament met, which lasted
even longer than the Long one par excellence, and indeed, the lengths
to which it went might alone have entitled it to the epithet bestowed
on its republican predecessor. The cavaliers had a very large
majority in this assembly, and the off-hand manner in which it dealt
with the country rendered the words cavalier treatment and bad
treatment synonymous. The royal prerogative was the object of
nearly all the acts of this assembly; and the rights of monarchy
were being continually declared, in the same spirit as the artist who
wrote " This is a lion," under his picture, because there would have
been room for doubt in the absence of the epigraph. Thus, the
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 289 -->
frequent assertions of the Parliament that the king was paramount,
and indeed absolute, were tolerably good evidence of the fact that
the position is not altogether incontrovertible.


After a brief session, in which the Cavaliers helped themselves to
£60,000, by way of compensation-money, and voted a supply to the
king, the Parliament adjourned from the 30th of July till the 28th of
November, by which time Charles and his minister, Clarendon, had
got up a little mare's-nest of a pretended conspiracy, to give a new
impetus to the prevailing spirit of inconsiderate loyalty. The servile
Commons called at once for a few supplementary executions, and
with this view it was resolved to look through the back numbers, or
stock remaining on hand of the regicides. Lord Monson, Sir Henry
Mildmay, and Sir Robert Wallop, were " unearthed" from the
obscurity into which they had crept, and were dragged on sledges,
with ropes round their necks, to Tyburn and back again. Poor
Wallop's name was cruelly made suggestive of ruffianly attacks,
which, by turning the first person present—Wallop—into the
participle in ing, the reader will at once mentally realise.


The subserviency of the Parliament to Charles was absolutely
sickening, and it is a fact worthy of remark, that the epithet " most
religious," applied to the sovereign in portions of the Church service,
was bestowed originally upon this profane and immoral reprobate.
His necessities, or rather his extravagances, were supplied lavishly
by Parliament, who voted him a hearth-tax for every fire-place, or in
other words, gave him a draft upon every chimney.
Notwithstanding the odious domestic character of Charles, every match-making
old mother of royalty abroad endeavoured to get off some daughter
by offering her as a wife to the heartless libertine. " He put himself
up to auction," says a brother historian,* and we may add that it is
much to be regretted he was not knocked down according to his
merits. Portugal having bid the Princess Catherine, with half a
million sterling, and other contingent advantages, the bargain was
struck, and a ship sent over for herself and her dowry.

weathercock, Sir Harry Vane, was brought to trial for having
compassed the death of Charles H., merely by accepting employment
under the Republican Government. Relying on the indemnity,
Vane had gone to live at Hampstead, when he found there was
something in the wind which gave him an unfavourable turn; but
it was too late for him to escape, and he was accordingly sent
to the Tower.


After the fashion of the period, poor Vane was condemned in the
opinion of his judges before he was tried, and he was not even
allowed to make a last dying speech; for the sheriff snatched the
document from which he was reading, drove away the reporters who
were taking notes, and ordered the drums to strike up a rataplan,
which overwhelmed the voice of the gallant soldier.


The exuberant loyalty of the people towards Charles received a
severe check, when, looking round for something to sell, in order to
support his extravagant habits, he determined to throw Dunkirk into
the market. Spain, Holland, and France were all in the field as
customers for the lot, which was eventually made over to the
lastnamed power for a few thousands, payable within three years by
bills, which were discounted at an alarming sacrifice.


Numerous Acts of oppression were passed by Charles, assisted by
his most servile Parliament; and among them, the Conventicle Act,
which forbade the Nonconformists from assembling anywhere but
in the established churches, under the penalty of transportation or
long imprisonment. Every loft, attic, or barn, where the Dissenters
had got together for psalm-singing purposes, was searched, and the
occupants were dragged away to the nearest prison.


The year 1665 was dreadfully signalised by the plague of London,
from which the king and court fled to Oxford, as if they were aware
that, by themselves at all events, the awful visitation was thoroughly
merited. While, however, the profligate king and his dissolute
companions escaped the physical consequences of a plague, the abandoned
crew carried with them wherever they went the malaria of a moral
pestilence. During the early part of 1666, the fever in the metropolis
subsided, and Charles with his courtiers came sneaking back to
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 291 -->
town, where they resumed their old habits as the " fast men" of
the period.


On the 2nd of September, in the same year, about the middle of
the night, some smoke issued from a baker's house near London
Bridge; but the watchman on duty, being asleep as a matter of
course, took no notice of the incident. The fire continued its
progress unchecked, for the people, instead of trying to put it out,
which they might have done at first, pumps as they were, began to
speculate on the subject of its origin. For some time it was reported
that Harry Marten, " the wit of the House of Commons," as he was,
on the lucus a non lucendo principle, called, had set the Thames on
fire by some brilliant flashes, and the ignition of the river had, it
was alleged, communicated itself to London Bridge, and thence to
the shop of the baker. Others declared the French had done the
mischief, and instead of arresting the flames, the mob began arresting
all the foreigners.


The usual casualties contributed to heighten the destructive effect
of the fire, for the parish engine had in the hurry of the moment
come out in the middle of the night without its hose, and the New
River had been smoking its pipe or soldering it for the purposes of
repair on the previous day, and neither of these aids to
anti-combustion was available. Poor Clarendon, the Chancellor, who had
got the reputation of being a great moral engine, was disturbed in
his sleep by some mischievous boys, who with a cry of " Fire ! fire! "
called upon the great moral engine to come and spout away upon
the burning city.


The devouring element continued its tremendous supper without
interruption, and there was, unfortunately, considerable difficulty in
administering anything to drink to allay the burning heat which was
rapidly consuming the whole metropolis. The most furious
conflagration will wear itself out in time, and the Fire of London, after
giving the inhabitants several " Nights wi' Burns," brought its own
progress to a conclusion. It is gratifying to be enabled to state,
that, even in the seventeenth century, the English were remarkable
for their charity, and the calamities that fell upon the metropolis—
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 292 -->
particularly the fire—stirred up the public benevolence to the fullest
extent, and inspired all classes with a warmth of feeling that was
quite appropriate.


• Charles having got all he could out of the people, for the purposes
of war, thought he might as well be paid on both sides, and began to
think of selling peace to his enemies. He entered into negotiations
with the Dutch, but before they had come to terms, he commenced
cutting down the expenses by selling the furniture of his fleets to the
dealers in marine stores, and dismissing his soldiers, in order to put
their pay into his own pocket. He was properly served for his selfish
parsimony by De Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, who, hearing that
Charles was doing everything upon a low and paltry scale, dashed at
the Medway, surprised Sheerness, and sacked not only the place, but
several cargoes of coals that were lying there. Upon the old English
principle of guarding the stable door after the furtive removal of the
horse, Charles prepared to collect a force to guard his country against
the injury it had already experienced. Twelve thousand men were
enrolled; but, during the process of enrolment, the enemy had got
safely off, and when the soldiers were assembled, it occurred suddenly
to the king that he had no means of paying them. As the Parliament
seemed quite unwilling to take this little responsibility off his hands,
the twelve thousand men were disbanded, all of them grumbling
furiously at having been made fools of by the bankrupt monarch.
Peace was concluded with De Ruyter just as if nothing had
happened; and though the English did not obtain all they asked,
they got the colony of New York, which was destined to give them
so much trouble at a far distant period.


The people were by no means satisfied with the terms of the treaty,
and as national ill-humour must always have a victim of some kind,
poor old Clarendon, the Chancellor, was pounced upon. The
Nonconformists hated him because he was a high churchman; the high
church party hated him because he wasn't; while the papists hated
him, they didn't exactly know why; and the courtiers hated him
because they had got a large balance of general animosity on hand
which they were determined to expend upon somebody. Clarendon,
in fact, was the grand centre in which all the detestation of the
<!-- Leaf 327, Page: 293 -->
country appeared to meet, or he might be more appropriately called
the bull's-eye of the target towards which the shafts of public
malignity were directed. Clarendon had been a faithful servant to
Charles, but the monarch's stock of gratitude had always been very
small, and what little he once possessed he had paid away long ago,
to less worthy objects. He accordingly sent to the Chancellor for the
Great Seal, but Clarendon pleading gout for not immediately leaving
home, promised that when he could get out he would call and leave
the official emblem at the palace. Charles replied, that as to
Clarendon's postponing his resignation till he could get out, he must get
out at once, if he wished to avoid an ejection of a not very
agreeable character. Urged by this formidable message, he took
Whitehall in his way during a morning's walk, and having seen the king,
made a desperate but useless struggle to retain the seal, which he was
forced to surrender. His misfortunes did not end here, for the
Commons impeached him; and Clarendon, as if owning the not very soft
impeachment, absconded to France, where he ended his days in exile.


A change of ministry ensued on the downfall of Clarendon, and
a government was formed which gave rise to almost the only
constitutional pun which we find recorded in history. The cabinet
received the name of the Cabal, from the five initial letters of the names
of the quintette to whom public affairs were intrusted. This great
national acrostic deserves better treatment than it has hitherto
received at the hands of the historians; and taking down our rhyming
dictionary from the cupboard in which it had been shelved, we
proceed to invest the political feu d'esprit with the dignity of poetry.  
  
  
  C was a Clifford, the Treasury's chief;
A was an Arlington, brilliant and brief;
B was a Buckingham—horrible scamp;
A was an Ashley, of similar stamp;
L was a Lauderdalc, Buckingham's pal.  
  
  
  Now take their initials to form a Cabal.


These five individuals looked upon politics as a trade, and
principles as the necessary capital, which must be turned over and
over again in order to realise extraordinary profits. They were all
of them out-pensioners on the bounty of France, and they soon
<!-- Leaf 328, Page: 294 -->
persuaded Charles that it was better to receive a fixed salary from
abroad, than trust for his supplies to the caprice of a Parliament.
The king, therefore, intrigued with several States at the same
moment, and was taking money from two or three different
governments, on the strength of treaties with each, some of which he all the
while intended to violate. He nevertheless did not disdain the money
of his own people, and extracted a sum of £310,000 from the public
pocket, in the shape of a supply from Parliament.


The domestic proceedings of the king were always of the most
disreputable kind, and he had lately taken up with one Mary or
Molly Davies, a jig dancer, who pretended to come of a very ancient
family in Moldavia. This wretched little ballet-girl was introduced
at court by the king, who was positively ambitious of being thought
rather "fast," an epithet which is generally bestowed on loose
characters. He had also formed an intimacy with Eleanor, or Nell
Gwynne, originally a vendor of " oranges, apples, nuts, and pears,"
but subsequently an actress; and it was said at the time—which is
some excuse perhaps for our saying it again—that Eleanor sounded
the knell of older favourites. Lady Castlemaine, who went by the
name of " the lady," was cut by the king, in favour of the fruit girl
and the figurante.


Notwithstanding the rivalry to which "the lady" was exposed,
her influence over the mind of Charles—if we may be allowed the
allegory—was still very considerable; and in the year 1670, which
was very soon after Miss M. Davies had danced herself into the good
graces of the king, he conferred the title of Duchess of Cleveland on
Lady Castlemaine. As many of our aristocratic families are fond of
tracing their origin to its very remotest source, we shall perhaps be
thanked for assisting some of them in the search to find the root of
their nobility. We however decline the, to us, wholly uninteresting
task, for we are quite content to take our Peerage as it comes, and
estimate its members for their personal worth, without reference to
their ancestors. We certainly should not value the vinegar in our
cruet any the more if we knew it comprised within it a dissolved
pearl, nor should we treasure a lump of charcoal on account of its
supposed relationship to some late lamented diamond.
<!-- Leaf 329, Page: 295 -->

With our accustomed fairness, we on the other hand have no
wish to throw a degraded and abandoned ancestry into the faces of
those who do not presume upon birth, but are decently thankful for
its worldly advantages. It is only when we find rank turning up its
nose at all inferior stations that we feel delight in seizing the
offending snout, and driving home the iron ring, to show a
connection between the proboscis of pride and the humbler materials

fectly intelligible, inasmuch as it told the Commons in very plain
terms that Charles " must have cash "—a necessity he shared with

later era. Taxation was therefore the order of the day, and after
putting a tax on everything in the shape of property or income, it
was proposed to attempt the forcing of a sanguineous extract from
stone, by putting a tax on actors' salaries. This, however, was so
preposterous an idea, that it was not followed up; for unless the
poor players had been allowed to pay the impost in gallery checks,
leaden dumps, and the other rubbish that forms the currency of the
stage, the taxes received from the dramatic fraternity would have
given the collectors a sinecure. Though enough money to pay
off the National Debt is frequently distributed in a single scene
by a stage philanthropist, or left by an old uncle in the course of
\"a tag " to a farce, there would be little prospect of the business
of the country being carried on if the supplies were contingent
on such resources as those which the actors dispose of with the
most lavish generosity.


The early part of the session was signalised by a frightful example
that was made of Sir John Coventry, who had ventured upon a joke
—an undertaking at all times perilous, and frequently entailing upon
the manufacturer the most alarming consequences. Sir John
endeavoured to be witty on the subject of a tax, but the joke, which is
happily lost in the mist of ages, was of so wretched a description that
a conspiracy was actually formed for the purpose of bringing the
perpetrator to punishment. The joke had reference to a private
matter into which it was thought Coventry had no right to poke his
nose, and this, being the offending feature, was severely handled by
his assailants, who took hold of it as a prominent point, and savagely
maltreated it. This was a specimen of the practical joking adopted
by the " fast men" of the time of Charles II., but the king was
obliged to affect disapprobation of such an act, and a law against
cutting and maiming was immediately passed, to protect all future
noses from the fate that had placed Coventry's nose in the hands of
those with whom he had fallen into bad odour.


In the same year the notorious Colonel Blood provided matter for
the penny-a-liner of his own day, and the historian of ours, by two
or three crimes of a very audacious character. One of these was to
waylay the Duke of Ormond as he was returning from a dinner-party
<!-- Leaf 331, Page: 297 -->
in the City, and was, from that very circumstance, most unlikely to
be in a fit state to defend himself. His Grace was placed upon a
horse, and carried towards Tyburn, but his coachman having
undertaken to overtake Blood, soon came up, to the consternation of the
latter, who could not understand what the former was driving at.
Blood, finding the coachman had the whip-hand of him, oozed quietly
away, but being incapable of keeping out of mischief, he was soon

detected in an attempt to steal the Crown jewels from the Tower.
This act of crowning audacity, as the merry monarch lugubriously
termed it, induced Charles to wish to " regale himself," as he said,
\"with the sight of a fellow who could be bold enough to attempt to
steal the regalia." The monarch, who had a sort of sympathy with
blackguardism of every description, was mightily taken with Blood,
whose bluntness made him pass for a very sharp blade, and the
ruffian was not only allowed to go at large, but received grants of
land without the smallest ground for such a mark of royal favour.


Charles and his people did not go on together in a spirit of
mutual confidence, for from a sort of instinctive appreciation of his
own demerits, he was afraid to trust his subjects, while theyreciproVOL. II. Q Q
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P331_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 332, Page: 298 -->
cated that distrust, from a due sense of the king's worthlessness. He
had therefore entered into some foreign alliances, of which he was
fearful they would disapprove, and he had accordingly prorogued
the Parliament, in the cowardly spirit of a man who, having some
bills he cannot meet, declines meeting his creditors. Supplies were,
however, necessary, and these he secured by going down to the
Exchequer, which he robbed of every farthing deposited there by the
merchants, who had been in the habit of leaving their loose cash in
the hands of the government, at a handsome rate of interest. When
remonstrated with on the subject of this disgraceful robbery, he
defended himself on the aieie-toi principle, declaring we were always
told to help ourselves, and that he had accordingly helped himself to
all he could lay his hands upon.


Being now in league with France, England waged war upon
Holland, but the Dutch metal of that country soon displayed itself.
The nation found in William, Prince of Orange, a leader who did not
give exactly the quarter implied in his name, but was merciful as far
as circumstances would permit to all his enemies. He expected
sympathy from the English Parliament, which Charles was afraid to
call until he found himself without a penny in his pocket, just like
the acknowledged scamp of domestic life, as represented in the
British Drama. The impossibility of proceeding without supplies
urged the king to take the dreaded step, and the writs for
summoning the Commons should have been couched in the old popular form
commencing, " Dilly, dilly, come and be killed; " for the Commons
were only called together to be victimised. It is a beautiful fact in
natural history, that even the donkey will kick when his patience is
too sorely tried; and the Commons, who had been wretchedly
subservient during Charles II.'s reign, began at last to show symptoms
of opposition under the insults they experienced. They were angry
at the war with Holland, and threatened to impeach Buckingham;
but Charles, comforting his favourite with the exclamation, " Don't
be alarmed, my Buck ! " took the utmost pains to screen him.


A negotiation was commenced for a peace with Holland, but this
was, after all, nothing better than a Holland blind, for Charles's
predilection for a French alliance was still perceptible. This occasioned
<!-- Leaf 333, Page: 299 -->
much dissatisfaction, and the people, being in the habit of
frequenting coffee-houses, talked about the matter over their cups, and were
very saucy over their saucers, which induced Charles to order the
closing of all those places where temperate refreshment was
obtainable. Thousands to whom coffee and bread and butter formed a
daily, and in many cases an only meal, were horrified at this
arrangement; while many who, not having a steak in the country,
got a chop in town, were disgusted beyond measure at the order,
which extended to taverns as well as to tea and coffee-shops. A
mandate which would have dashed the muffin from the mouth of
moderation, and turned all the tea into another channel, was certain
not to be obeyed, and the doors of the marts for Mocha in your own
mugs—a term synonymous with mouths—continued open as usual.


Urged by the remonstrances and clamour of the people, Charles
entered into an alliance with William, Prince of Orange, who married
the Princess Mary, the eldest daughter of James, the young lady being
used, like so much of the cement distinguished as " Poo-Loo's," for
the purpose of mending the breakages that had occurred on both
sides. William was as deep as Charles, and soon began to pooh!
pooh! the idea of having, cemented, a la Poo-Loo, a rupture of such
long standing, and he positively refused to fall into Charles's projects.


The state of Scotland was not more satisfactory than that of
England at this time, for the Covenanters were striving vigorously
against the constituted authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical.
Lauderdale, who represented the king, enrolled twenty thousand
militia-men; but had he enrolled, or rolled up in old coats, as
many scarecrows, they would have been quite as serviceable as
the new soldiery.


The recent regicide having caused a reaction in favour of royalty,
it became a common trick with the king's party to get up a report of
the intended assassination of Charles H., whenever the stock of
popularity was running rather short, and the people seemed to be getting
dissatisfied with the government. In the absence of real objects of
suspicion, there is never any difficulty among Englishmen in drawing
upon their inventive resources for materials to make a panic, whether
<!-- Leaf 334, Page: 300 -->
monetary, political, or otherwise; and about the year 1670, rumour
was very busy in manufacturing all sorts of plots against the life of
the sovereign. On the morning of the 13th of August, which
happened to be one of the dog-days, Charles was walking with his dogs
in the Park, when Kirby, the chemist—a highly respectable man,
but an egregious blockhead—drew to the monarch's side, andwhisCharles 18 Informed of a plot against his precious 'Ife.

pered in the royal ear, " Keep within the company; your enemies
have a design upon your life, and you maybe shot in this very walk."
Charles, who was a little flurried, desired to know the meaning of
this warning, when Kirby the chemist offered to produce one Doctor
Tongue, a weak-minded and credulous old parson, who said he had
heard that two fellows, named Grove and Pickering, were making
arrangements for smashing Charles on the very first opportunity.
This Tongue was so exceedingly slippery that he could not be
believed; but to keep himself out of a pickle, he brought a pile of papers,
containing a copious account of the alleged conspiracy. He alleged
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P334_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 335, Page: 301 -->
that he had found them pushed under his door; but we cannot very
easily believe that any conspirators would have been so foolish as
to go about, dropping promiscuously into letter-boxes, or thrusting
under street-doors, the proofs of their designs on the sovereign.


Upon further inquiry being prosecuted, it turned out that a low
fellow, named Titus Oates, was at the bottom of this plot, to raise
the apprehensions of the public. Oates was a man of straw, the son
of an Anabaptist preacher; and our antiquarian recollections have
reminded us, that from the extraordinary propensity of Oates to
deceive by false representations, the application of the term " chaff,"
to stories at variance with fact, most likely owes its origin. Happy
had it been for many in those days, if Oates had been so dealt with,
that the chaff had been all thrashed out of him. The fellow is
described by a writer of the period, as " a low man of an ill cut and
very short neck," with a mouth in the middle of his face; " whereas,"
says the old biographer, "the nose should always form the scenter."
\"If you had put a compass between his lips," continues the quaint
chronicler we quote, " you might have swept his nose, forehead, and
chin, within the same diameter." This places the nasal organ in a
high, but certainly not a very proud position, bringing it nearly
flush with the eyes, and making it a sort of inverted comma on
the summit of that index which the face is said to afford to the
human character.


The stories got up by Oates were of the most elaborately absurd
description, betraying an equal ignorance of grammar, geography,
and every other branch of information, polite or otherwise. He
contradicted himself over and over again; but this only rendered his
story the more marvellous, and as the lower orders of English were
always fond of the most extravagant fictions, the terrific tales of
Oates were not too absurd to be swallowed. He became the most
successful political novelist ever known, and received a pension of
£1200 a year, besides lodgings in Whitehall, by way of recognition
for his services in contributing to the amusement of the people, by
frightening them out of their propriety.  
  
  
  The success of Oates induced a number of imitators, each of whom
<!-- Leaf 336, Page: 302 -->
contrived to discover a plot to murder the king, with a complete set
of written documents, to prove the existence of the foul conspiracy.
One of these speculators on royal and public credulity was a man
named William Bedloe, a fellow who, having failed as a thief, and
been detected as a cheat, attempted to repair his fortunes by turning
patriot. With the usual injudicious energy of mere imitation, he
went much further than even Oates himself in the audacity of his
statements. These two miscreants between them sent many
innocent people to the scaffold, for if Oates only hinted his suspicion of a
plot, Bedloe was at hand to swear to the persons involved in it. As
surely as Oates declared his knowledge of some intended
assassination, Bedloe would come forward to indicate not only the assassins
themselves, but to point to the very weapons they would have used,
when, if it was replied they did not belong to the parties against
whom the charge was made, he would not scruple to swear that the
instruments would have been purchased on the next day, for the
deadly purpose. All the rules of evidence were outraged without the
slightest remorse, and poor Starkie * would have gone stark staring
mad, could he have witnessed the flagrant violations of those
principles which he has expounded with so much ability.


The Parliament which sat during these proceedings was in
existence for seventeen years, and has gained, or rather has deserved, an
undying reputation by the passing of the Habeas Corpus Act. This
glorious statute prohibited the sending of anyone to prison beyond
the sea, and allowed anyone in jail to insist on being carried before
a judge to inquire the cause of his detention. A troublesome captive
might therefore, by pretending never to be satisfied with the
explanation of the Court, keep running perpetually backwards and forwards
to ascertain the reason of his captivity. The Oates conspiracy had
not yet undergone the winnowing which the breath of public opinion
—universally right, in the long run—was sure at one time or another
to bestow, when a new affair, called the Meal-Tub Plot, burst on the
attention of the community. A fellow of the name of Dangerfield
affected to have discovered a new field of danger in an alleged


* Starkie and Phillips are, at this day, the two acknowledged authorities on the
Law of Evidence.
<!-- Leaf 337, Page: 303 -->
design to set up a new form of government. This reprobate had
been in the pillory, where it is believed the quantity of eggs that met
his eye, gave him the notion of hatching a plot, and he obtained the
assistance of one Cellier, a midwife, to bring the project into
existence. There was something very melodramatic in the mode of
getting up accusations of treason in the days of Dangerfield, for it
was only necessary to drop some seditious papers in a man's house,
or stuff the prospectus of a revolution into his pocket, in order to
make him responsible for all the consequences of a crime he had
perhaps never dreamed about. Colonel Mansel was the intended victim
in the Dangerfield affair; and some excise officers who had been
sent to his lodgings under the pretence of being ordered to search
for contraband goods, found the heads of a conspiracy cut and dried,
crammed in among his bed-clothes. The Colonel succeeded in
showing that he had nothing to do with the transaction, and declared that,
\"as he had made his bed, so was he content to lie upon it." His words
carried conviction home to the minds of all, and Dangerfield was obliged
to admit the imposture he had practised; but he confessed another
conspiracy, the particulars of which were found regularly written out
and deposited in a meal-tub in the house of Cellier, the midwife.


It is evident from numerous instances, that conspirators in those
days were very apt to carry their designs no further than committing
them to paper, and carefully depositing in some place or other the
records of their crime, so that in case of detection the evidence against
themselves would be complete and irresistible. Thus had the plotters
with whom Dangerfield had been acting in concert, put away in a
meal-tub the evidence of their intended proceedings, for no other
purpose which we can perceive, than the ultimate finding of the
documents, and the furtherance of the ends of justice in the true poetical
fashion. Lady Powis was implicated in this affair, and was sent to
the Tower; but the Grand Jury ignored the bill against her, while
Cellier, the midwife, who had aided in the miserable abortion, was
tried and acquitted at the Old Bailey.


The rumour, or the reality of conspiracies against the royal family,
did not prevent Charles from throwing himself into the pleasures, or
rather the dissipations, for which his Court was remarkable. Though
<!-- Leaf 338, Page: 304 -->
political liberty was exceedingly scarce during his reign, he did not
discourage the taking of liberties in private life, among those who
formed the society by which he was surrounded. The palace was one
continued scene of that degrading excitement which passessomeHoble Lord.—"I believe I'm engaged to your La'shlp for the next dance."

times by the name of gaiety, and nearly every evening was devoted
to that sort of entertainment which is sought by the snobs and
shopboys of our own day in the Casinos and masked balls. The " Fast"
mania, which thrusts at this moment the penny cheroot between the
lips of infancy, drags the clerk from the desk to the dancing rooms,
and perhaps urges his felonious hand to his master's till, had in the
time of Charles II. corrupted the whole nation, from the highest to
the lowest, so that even the best society—and bad indeed was the
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P338_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 339, Page: 305 -->
best—bore the impress of the example that was furnished by the
king himself. The palace balls were accordingly conducted in a
manner that would disgrace the humblest of modern hops, and in
these days deprive of its license any place of public entertainment
where such behaviour would be permitted by the conductors of the
establishment.

The particulars of the sacrifice of Stafford afford such a faithful
sample of the mode in which justice was administered in the reign of
Charles II., that, converting ourselves into " our own reporter," we
give a brief sketch of the trial. The defendant in the action, which
was in the nature of an impeachment, was accused of high treason,
and the three witnesses against him were Oates, Dugdale, and
Turberville, three scamps who made a regular business—and a very
profitable one—of giving false evidence. Oates swore he had seen
somebody deliver a document signed by somebody else, appointing
Stafford paymaster to some army, which at some time or other was
going to be got together somehow, somewhere, for the purpose of
doing something against the Government, and in favour of the
Catholics. Dugdale swore that the accused had engaged him,
Dugdale, to murder the king at so much a week, with the offer of a
saintdom in the next year's Almanack. Turberville swore ditto to
Dugdale, and though Stafford was able to disprove their evidence in
many very important points, the trio of perjurers had gone so boldly
to work that there was a large balance of accusation remaining over
that could not be upset, in consequence of the unfortunate
impossibility of proving a negative.


Stafford succeeded in damaging the credit of the witnesses, but
as they came forward professedly in the character of hard swearers,
who, so as they got the prisoners executed, were indifferent about
being believed, the attack on their reputations affected them very
little. The unhappy prisoner was so taken aback by the effrontery
of his accusers, that he hardly gave himself a fair chance in his
defence, which consisted chiefly of ejaculations expressive of wonder
at the excessive impudence and audacity of the witnesses. Such
exclamations as "Well I'm sure! what next?" though natural
enough under the circumstances, did not make up, when all put
together, a very eloquent speech for the defence, and after a trial of
six days' duration, the peers, by a majority of twenty four, found
poor Stafford guilty.


Sentence of death was passed upon him, but the more
ignominious portion of the punishment having been remitted by the king's
order, the two sheriffs were seized with a most sanguinary fit of
<!-- Leaf 341, Page: 307 -->
system, and objected to the omission of hanging and quartering,
because, as they said, the leaving out of these barbarities would be
altogether irregular. In order to satisfy the scruples of these very
punctilious gentlemen, the peers pronounced them "over nice," and
the Commons passed a resolution of indemnity, by which the sheriffs
were made aware that they would not be considered to have
\"scamped " their work, if they merely cut off Stafford's head without
proceeding to the more artistical details of butchery.


Stafford died nobly, and the fickle populace, who had howled for
his condemnation, began sighing and grieving at his fate; but as all
this sympathy was almost in the nature of a post obit, it was of little
or no value to the nobleman on whose behalf it was contributed.
The executioner himself turned tender-hearted at the last moment,
and twice raised the fatal axe, but a coarse brute near him on the
scaffold—perhaps one of the thwarted sheriffs—desired the
headsman not to make two bites at a cherry, and the blow was forthwith
administered.


These excesses of the Parliament caused even the dissolute
Charles to try the effect of dissolution; but there was no going
on for any length of time without a House of Commons to vote
the supplies; and the king, thinking to withdraw the legislature
from the influence of London mobs, appointed the next to be
held at Oxford. This arrangement gave great dissatisfaction to
the opposition, and both parties came as if prepared for a battle,
the speakers on each side being, no doubt, abundantly supplied
with the leaden ammunition that is customarily used for debating
purposes. It was during the party bickerings prevailing about this
time, that the definitions, since so famous—and sometimes so
infamous—of Whig and Tory, were first hit upon. The former
was given to the popular party, merely because it had been given
to some other popular party, in some other place, at some previous
time, and the latter was given to the courtiers, because some
popish banditti in Ireland had been once called Tories; * but why


* Somebody, who was of course a nobody, says the word Tory is derived from
Torreo, to roast, because the Tories were always clever at roasting their antagonists.
<!-- Leaf 342, Page: 308 -->
they had been, or why, if they had been, the courtiers of Charles II.'s
time need have been, are points that the reader's ingenuity must
serve him to elucidate.


The king had usually been civil enough to his Parliaments, but on
the occasion of the assembly at Oxford he determined to speak his
mind, and his speech, being a reflection of his mind, was of course
very rambling and irregular. He complained of the last Parliament
having been refractory, and expressed a hope that the " present
company" would know how to behave themselves. He disavowed
all idea of acting in an arbitrary manner himself, but he was
thoroughly determined not to be "put upon" by anyone else; and
so now they knew what he meant, and he trusted that no
misunderstanding would arise to mar their efforts for the public benefit. The
Commons listened to all this with a few mental " Oh, indeed's!"
"Dear me's !" "No! 'Pon your honour's!" and "You don't say
so's ! " but they were not in the least over-awed, and they set to work
exactly in the old way to choose the same Speaker and adopt the
same measures as the last Parliament, of which many of them had
been members.


The new Parliament was of course found by Charles to be no
better than any of its predecessors, and when it was a week old he
jumped into a sedan chair, had the crown put under the seat, and
the sceptre slung across the back, when, in reply to the chairman's
enquiry, " Where to, your honour ?" the sovereign, with a dignified
voice, directed that he might be run down to the place where
Parliament was sitting. This was the morning of the 28th of March, and
Charles, bursting into the hall where the Lords had met, dissolved
the fifth and the last of his parliaments.


This proceeding, which, in the days of a monarchy's decline,
would have been exclaimed against as highly unconstitutional, was
hailed as a piece of vigour at a time when royalty, having been
recently maltreated, united in its favour the general sympathies.
Charles, finding that courage was likely to tell, became very liberal
of its exercise, and began to abuse the opponents of his policy with
more than common energy. " There is nothing like taking the bull
<!-- Leaf 343, Page: 309 -->
by the horns," Charles would say to his intimate friends, " and John
Bull especially should be taken by the horns, to prevent his making
unpleasant use of them."


Shortly after the dissolution, Charles brought out for general
perusal a justification of the course he had thought proper to pursue;
for, like many other people in the world, he first took a step, and
then began to look for the reasons of his having taken it. The
opposition brought out a reply, written by Messrs. Somers, Sydney,
and Jones, but it did not sell, and as these gentlemen could not
afford to give it away, it had very little influence. Charles managed
to get a number of addresses presented to him, congratulating him
on his deliverance from the republicans, but the Lord Mayor and
Common Council having come down to Windsor with an address of
a different kind, were told that the king was not at home, but they
had better go to Hampton Court. On their arriving at the latter
address there was a great deal of whispering among the royal
servants, who would give no other information than the words, " Yes,
yes; it's all right! " At length, upon a signal from above, a
domestic exclaimed, " Now, then, gentlemen, you may walk up; " and on
going into a room on the first floor, they found the Lord Chancellor
sitting there, looking as black as thunder. His Lordship, putting
on a voice to match his countenance, began asking them how they
dared to come with anything like a remonstrance to their sovereign;
and the Lord Mayor, with the Common Council, slinking timidly out
of the room, made the best of their way back to the point they had
started from.


A few more plots of an insignificant character were got up against
the Government, but met with no success; and the Rye-House
conspiracy, so called perhaps from the wry faces the parties put on when
they were found out, stands out from among the rest, which have
been long ago buried under their own insignificance. Some have
suggested that the Rye-House plot was a name invented as a kind
of sequel to the notion of Oates, and the conspiracy of the Meal-Tub;
but the hypothesis is far too trifling for us to dwell upon. As it has
taken a position of some importance in history, we must furnish a
few particulars of this Rye-House plot, which, in the old nursery
<!-- Leaf 344, Page: 310 -->
song,* taking for its theme the domestic arrangements of royalty,
seems to have had a slight foreshadowing.


On the 12th of June, 1683, one Josiah Keyling, who had formerly
been a red-hot Whig, and was by trade a salter, was seized with the
infamous idea of applying his skill in business to the affairs of his
country, which he resolved to put, if he could, into a precious pickle.
He went to Lord Dartmouth, for the purpose of revealing a
conspiracy that had been formed to take away the king's life; and he
declared one Burton, a decayed cheesemonger, Thompson, a carver,
who had been trying to carve his own fortunes in vain, and Barber,
an instrument-maker, as his accomplices in the intended act of
regicide. They were all to have gone down to the house of one Rumbold,
a maltster, at a place called the Rye, where they were to have taken
a chop, and cut off the king and his brother on their return from
Newmarket. They were to have purchased blunderbusses, but,
perhaps by some blunder, missing the 'bus, the London conspirators
never left town, and did not arrive at the " little place " of Rumbold
the maltster.


The disclosures made by Keyling included, at first, a few
names only; but, as a brother historians has well and playfully
suggested, " he subsequently went into a regular crescendo
movement," and indulged in an ad libitum, introducing several new
accompaniments to the strain he had originally adopted, besides
adding new circumstances and dragging new persons into his
accusation, without the slightest regard to harmony of detail. He at
length went off into a largo of such wide and unmeasured scope,
that he included William Lord Russell in the charges made, and his
lordship was committed to the Tower.


Lord Grey, who was also accused, was rather more fortunate; for
having been taken in the first instance to the home of the jailer, he
had the satisfaction of finding that official reeling about in a state of
helpless drunkenness. Lord Grey, perceiving that the functionary

<!-- Leaf 345, Page: 311 -->
who had charge of him was not in a situation to appreciate any
consideration that might be shown to him, quietly walked out at the
doorway of the serjeant's house, and jumping into a boat on the
Thames, hailed a ship for Holland. Lord Howard of Escrick,
another of the alleged conspirators, was pulled neck and heels down
a chimney, into which he had climbed for concealment, in his house
at Knightsbridge. His character has been blackened almost as much

as his dress, by this ignoble act, for it is recorded of him that when
pulled out from the grate, he looked fearfully little. He trembled,
sobbed, and wept, or in other words, had a regular good cry, and
the tears forming channels through the soot, rendered his aspect
exceedingly ludicrous. He at once confessed that he did not come
out of the affair with clean hands, but he was guilty of the very dirty
trick of implicating many of his own friends and kindred by his
pusillanimous confession.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P345_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 346, Page: 312 -->

Besides other less illustrious victims, Lord Russell was sacrificed;
and his kinsman Howard, whom we have just had the pleasure of
dragging before the world from the chimney into which he had
slunk, was one of the witnesses against the nobleman we have
mentioned. Russell behaved with great dignity throughout his trial and
during its fatal result; but the execution was scarcely over, when
the town rang with his last speech, of which some enterprising
Catnach of the period had obtained the manuscript. It was actually
in print before the fatal event took place; but there is every reason
to believe that it was genuine, for speculation had not in those days
learned to anticipate reports, notwithstanding the occurrence of the
events described in them having been by some accident prevented.


Individuals of lesser note than Russell, were condemned to share
his fate, and among them was one Rouse, who was executed at
Tyburn for having endeavoured to Rouse the populace. A
declaration, containing a narrative of the Rye-House Plot, was published
by the king, who was exceedingly fond of performing the office of
his own historian. It enabled him to " touch up" the events in
which he himself was concerned, and give them a colouring
favourable to himself; but happily for the cause of truth, notes were being
taken on its behalf, and materials were thus collected for such truthful
chronicles as those the reader's eye now rests upon.


The trial and death of Algernon Sidney, the last of the
Commonwealth-men, took place soon after Russell's execution. Though it is
to be hoped that few people in these days can be ignorant of the
character of this remarkable man, yet there may be a section of the
British public from whom will have burst the cry of " Sidney ! Who
is Sidney ! " directly we mentioned him. Sidney then—we state the
fact for the benefit of the benighted classes—was son of the Earl of
Leicester, and had always been a republican, and had been named
one of the judges on the trial of the king; but he was either too lazy
or too loyal to take his seat amongst them. He opposed Cromwell's
elevation, from which it might have been inferred that he would have
had no objection to the Restoration; but he opposed that, and
having nothing else to excite his resistance, he opposed himself by
refusing to take advantage of a general bill of indemnity.
<!-- Leaf 347, Page: 313 -->

He had been obliged to remain out of England, but finding that
he was seriously opposing his own interest by his absence from
home, he applied for the king's pardon, which was sent him by an
early post, and he arrived in England with his protection in his
pocket. Party spirit was running very high when Sidney returned,
and he was not the man to do anything with a view to moderation,
so that he was soon at his old trick of opposing the government.
He began talking largely about liberty, and he was really going on
in a very improper way, for he fell into the common error of patriots,
namely, that of spouting common place claptraps instead of
attempting every legal means to bring about a reform of the evils that may
be in need of remedy.


Sidney now became a marked man, whom the royalists were
determined to crush, and a pretext was speedily found for bringing
him to trial. Several witnesses were brought forward to prove the
existence of a plot; but what plot, and what Sidney had to do with
it, or whether he was concerned in it at all, did not form any part of
the subject of the evidence. Having established a plot, the next
thing to be done was to show that Sidney was at the head of it, and
the abject Howard—no relation to the philanthropist—made his
sixth or seventh appearance as a royalist witness for the purpose
specified. According to law, it was necessary to have the testimony
of a second person; but there were not two Howards in the world,
and a supplementary scoundrel to swear away Sidney's life was
nowhere to be met with.


Some papers found in the house of the accused, were examined in
lieu of a second witness; and though this was a flagrant evasion of
the law, the proceeding was pronounced by the infamous Jeffreys to
be perfectly regular. He asserted that written documents were better
than living witnesses, for the former could not give an evasive reply;
but the judicial villain forgot that the papers, unless the writing
happened to be crossed, would not admit of the test of
cross-examination like other witnesses. Sidney pleaded that his hand-writing had
not been proved; and that even supposing him to be the author of
the documents, he might have been " only in fun;" but this was a
frivolous excuse, for it is clear that if " only in fun " were a good  
  
  
  VOL. II. S S
<!-- Leaf 348, Page: 314 -->
plea, there would be great difficulty in getting over it. A verdict of
\"Guilty " was returned by a jury so discreditably packed, that the
box in which they sat should have been called a packing-case.


Judge Jeffreys " came out" exceedingly on the occasion of Sidney's
sentence being passed, and insisted on proceeding to the last
extremity, notwithstanding a mass of irregularities having been pointed
out to him. Jeffreys would listen to nothing in the prisoner's favour;
and upon one Mr. Bampfield, a barrister, venturing an opinion as
amicus curiæ, that unhappy junior was smashed, snubbed, and
silenced by the judge, who recommended the learned gentleman to
confine himself to those points of practice upon which his opinion
was required.


The scene between Sidney and Judge Jeffreys degenerated into
a mere personal squabble before the unhappy affair was concluded,
and it ended in Jeffreys telling Sidney to keep cool, while the judge
himself was boiling over with rage, and the prisoner tauntingly
requested his "lordship" to feel his—the prisoner's—pulse, which
the latter declared was more than usually temperate. Sidney
followed the practice, prevalent at the time, of placing a paper in the
hands of the sheriff by way of legacy on the scaffold; but we have
been unable to account for the strange partiality felt by persons
at the point of death for the individual principally concerned in
their execution.


Hampden was selected as the next victim to the political
persecution so much in vogue during Charles's reign, but it was thought
more profitable to fine this gentleman than to execute him, and he
was adjudged to pay a penalty of £40,000, which added a large sum
to the royal treasury, besides saving the executioner's fee and the
cost of a scaffold. Judge Jeffreys, though baulked in this instance of
an opportunity for gratifying his sanguinary propensities, took his
revenge upon some inferior prisoners, for it was his practice when
one eluded the gallows by any chance, to hang two, as a poor
compensation for the disappointment he had suffered. Professor
Holloway, who had been concerned in the Rye-House Plot, was accordingly
condemned to death, with Sir Thomas Armstrong, who had had a
small and very unprofitable share in the same conspiracy.
<!-- Leaf 349, Page: 315 -->

Judge Jeffreys, who figured in these sanguinary transactions, was
one of the most extraordinary specimens of ruffianism that the world
ever produced; and if history—like Madame Tussaud—were to get up
a Chamber of Horrors, Judge Jeffreys would certainly take his place
in it by the side of Danton, Sawney Bean, Marat, Mrs. Brownrigg,
and Robespierre. Before he went on circuit he used to say he was
going to give the provinces "a lick with the rough side of his
tongue"—a vulgar threat which he carried out to its fullest extent,
for he not only used his tongue, but his teeth, in the lickings he
administered to the unfortunate prisoners brought before him for
trial. He was not much interested in dry points of law, and indeed
he endeavoured to moisten them as much as he could by drinking
copiously before he went into court, and he sometimes reeled about
so unsteadily as he took his place on the bench, that a facetious
usher of the period declared Jeffreys should be called the Master of
the Rolls, for he was always rolling about from side to side, when he
approached the seat of judgment.


The king endeavoured, by courting personal popularity, to avert
from himself some of the odium that attached to his creatures and
his government. Knowing that the suspicion of his entertaining
popish predilections was very much about, he married his niece, the
Lady Anne, to Prince George of Denmark, a Protestant. No
consideration would induce him, however, to call another Parliament,
and though he was bothered for money on all sides, without the
power of raising a supply, he preferred, as he said, " rubbing on,"
to the chance of getting some much harder rubs from the legislative
body, in the event of one having been summoned.


He greatly preferred doing just as he pleased with other people's
money, to the annoyance of getting any of his own upon the
conditions that a Parliament would certainly have attached to the
grant of it. His credit being almost unlimited, he never wanted for
anything that cash could procure; and he led a much more
independent life by setting Parliament at defiance, and having nothing
to thank it for, than he could have done had he called it together,
and taken an annual supply, the amount of which would have been
in some measure contingent on his good behaviour.
<!-- Leaf 350, Page: 316 -->

Charles had become as absolute as the last case of a Latin noun,
but he was not happy, and his gaiety beginning to forsake him, the
picture of the sad dog was gloomily realised. He fell into a
succession of fits of the Blues, and on Monday, the 2nd of February, 1685,
he put his hand to his head, turned very pale, and seemed to be in a
very shaky condition. Dr. King, an eminent physician, with a taste
for experimental philosophy, was sent for; but his experiments
either failed, or were put off too long, for Charles fell on the floor as
if dead when the Doctor arrived to prescribe for him. Dr. King
resolved on bleeding the royal patient, who came to as fast as he
had gone off, and in a fit of generosity the Council ordered the
surgeon £1000, which, in a fit of oblivion, was forgotten, and he was
never paid anything. Perhaps payment may have been disputed, on
the ground that the doctor's treatment had not been permanently
effective, for a bulletin had scarcely been issued declaring the king
out of danger, when it was found necessary to issue another bulletin
declaring him in again.


The physicians handed him over to the ministers of the church,
but Charles would not have about him any Protestant divine, and
the Duchess of Portsmouth then told it as a great secret to the
French ambassador, that the king, at the bottom of his heart, was
a Catholic. This information revealed two facts about which there
might have been considerable doubt, namely, that the king
possessed some religion, though it was the one which he had been
during the whole of his reign persecuting and executing others for
following; and secondly, that he had a heart sufficiently capacious
for any moral or virtuous principle to lie at the bottom of.


The moment the true character of Charles's faith was known to
the French ambassador, he used his utmost ingenuity to smuggle a
confessor to the death-bed of the sovereign. The English Bishops,
however, stuck to the expiring monarch so pertinaciously that no
Romish priest could approach, until one Huddleston was hunted up,
who had formerly been a Popish clergyman, but had so terribly
neglected his business, that the office of confessor was quite strange to
him. A wig and gown were put upon him to disguise him, and he
was taken to a Portuguese monk to be " crammed " for the task he
<!-- Leaf 351, Page: 317 -->
had to perform; and having been brought up the back staircase to
the royal chamber, he got through the duty very respectably. Such
was the disreputable imposture that was resorted to for supplying
Charles II. with the only religious assistance or consolation that he
received before his dissolution. The Protestant Bishops, who had
been all hurried into the next room, did not know exactly what to
make of it; but there were various whispers and shrewd suspicions
current among the churchmen and the courtiers.


Soon after his interview with Huddleston, who was huddled up in
a cloak to get him out of the palace without being discovered, Charles
got a little better, and sent for his illegitimate children to give them
his blessing. A catalogue of these young ladies and gentlemen
would occupy more space perhaps than they are worth, but it is
sufficient perhaps to say, that Master Peg and Miss Peg, the king's
son and daughter by Mrs. Catharine Peg, were absent from the
family circle in consequence of their having died in their infancy.
Master James Walters, the eldest of the group of naturals, who had
been created Duke of Monmouth, was not mentioned by his father
in his last illness; but little Charley Lennox, the young Duke of
Richmond, and his mother, the Duchess of Portsmouth—alias
Mademoiselle Querouaille—were especially recommended to the Duke of
York's attention. The dying reprobate had the good feeling to put
in a word for Mrs. Eleanor Gwynne, the actress, ancestress of the
noble house of St. Alban's; but as he only said, "Do not let poor
Nelly starve," it does not seem that his views with regard to her
were very munificent.


The Bishops, however, were scandalized selon les regies at even
this brief allusion to the " poor player," who had invariably refused
all titles of honour; but it is said that their holinesses were not
nearly so much shocked at the mention of the Duchesses of
Portsmouth and Cleveland, who were morally not a bit better than Nell
Gwynne, though they had electrotyped their infamy with rank, which
formed in those days, as we are happy to say it does not in these,
the only real substitute for virtue.


At six in the morning of the 6th of February, 1685, Charles
asked what o'clock it was, and requested those about him to open
<!-- Leaf 352, Page: 318 -->
the curtains that he might once more see daylight. Where he was
to see it at that time of the morning in the darkest period of the year
is, like the daylight itself, under such circumstances, not very visible.
His senses, which must have been already wandering, were by ten
o'clock quite gone, and at half-past eleven he expired without a
struggle. He was in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the
twentyfifth of his actual reign, though, according to legal documents, he
was king for thirty-six years, inasmuch as while he was flying
about from place to place, and perching upon trees to elude
discovery, he was supposed, by a loyal fiction, to be still sitting on the
throne of England.


A report got abroad that Charles had been poisoned, but although
this deadly operation had been performed on his mind by the evil and
corrupt councillors into whose hands he fell after the death of
Clarendon, there is no reason for believing that physical poisoning was the
fate of this disreputable sovereign.


The characters of the kings and queens it is our duty to pass in
review give many a pang to our loyal bosom, and we regret to say
that our heart has been perforated, nay, riddled to an alarming extent,
by the melancholy riddle which the character of Charles presents to
us. We will begin with him as a companion—not that we should be
very anxious for his company, but because it was in the capacity of
a companion that he presented the most amiable aspect.


His manners were engaging; but as his engagements were
scarcely ever kept, the quality in question was only calculated to
lead to disappointment among those who had anything to do with
him. His wit, raillery, and satire are said to have been first-rate,
but we find none of his bon-mots recorded which would have been
worth more than two-pence a dozen to any regular dealer in
jokes, though for private distribution they might have been a little
more valuable, on account of their royal authorship. For his private
life he has found apologists in preceding historians,* one of whom
appears to imagine that the disgusting selfishness familiarly termed  
  
  
  * Hume calls him "an obliging husband."
<!-- Leaf 353, Page: 319 -->
"jolly dogism" is the highest social virtue of which human nature
is capable.


Charles was, we are told, a good father, but it was to those of
whom he ought never to have been the father at all; a generous
lover to those whom he could not make the objects of generosity
without the grossest injustice to others; and a pleasing companion
to those with whom he ought to have avoided all companionship.  
  
  
  The Merry Monarct

We do not concur in that sort of laxity which looks at the domestic
ties as so many slip-knots that may hang about the wearer as
loosely as he may find convenient.


For his public character, even those who admire him in his private
relations have not ventured to offer any apology; and his utter
disregard of the honour, the religion, the liberty, and the material
interests of the nation over which he ruled, cannot be made the
subject of laudation. It is suggested that a certain reckless gaiety
formed some excuse for his defects as a sovereign; but monarchy in
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P353_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 354, Page: 320 -->
sport, becomes tyranny in earnest, when its affairs are conducted by
a negligent and heartless libertine. His reign was one long hoax as
far as religion was concerned, for he was a Catholic at heart while
pursuing the Papists with the most cruel persecution; and though
his behaviour towards that class would, under any circumstances,
have been hateful, it seems doubly detestable when we remember
that he was himself guilty of holding the opinions for which he sent
so many to the scaffold.


There can be no doubt that the fate of his father, and the disgust
occasioned by the tyranny arising out of the ascendency of the rabid
friends of freedom during the Commonwealth, were mainly
instrumental in obtaining toleration for the vices and oppressive cruelties of
Charles II. The dissatisfaction caused by the abuse of the royal
power in the preceding reign must have burst out with more
earnestness had it been kept bottled up until the accession of the libertine
monarch, whose supposed sufferings during exile had attracted
towards him a large share of sympathy. Had he come to the throne
in due course, without the intervention of a republic, he would have
been swept off by a storm of general indignation; but the rebound
of public feeling in favour of monarchy carried him in triumph to the
same position that his father had occupied.


It was remarked of Charles II., that he never said a foolish thing,
or ever did a wise one; an observation which either he—or some one
for him—happily turned to account, by observing that his words
were his own, while his acts were those of his ministry. He has left
nothing very valuable to posterity, notwithstanding the alleged wit
or wisdom of his words, for the only persons who have been able to
turn him to profitable account, are the dramatists, who have founded
a few farces on the career of that sad scamp—the Merry Monarch.

James and his wife were greatly puzzled about their coronation,

Protestant prelate, and unfortunately for them " No other was
genuine." By an arrangement with their own conscience—a party,

—James and his queen not only accepted the crown from Protestant
hands, but got over an awkward oath or two by means of some mental

quibbles. As the crown was being put upon his head, it tottered
and almost fell, which caused a bystander to paraphrase the old
saying about the slip 'twixt cup and lip, exclaiming—  
  
  
  " There's many a mull  
  
  
  'Twixt the crown and the skull,"

an observation that, happily for him who made it, was uttered in a
tone that was scarcely audible.


A few days after the coronation, Titus Oates was brought to the
bar of the Queen's Bench to be tried over again, though he was
already under sentence of perpetual imprisonment. James, however,
was desirous of feeding his revenge on Oates, who had done his
worst against the Catholics; and Jeffreys, that judicial flail, was set
to work to administer to Oates a sound thrashing.


The prisoner assumed a very bold front, and there was a sort of
desperate restlessness in his manner, which got him the name of
Wild Oates at the time he was undergoing his trial. He was
convicted on two indictments, and ordered to pay a thousand marks in
respect of each. " But," said the inhuman Jeffreys, "we will supply
him with marks in return, for he shall be whipped from Aldgate to
Newgate, and from Newgate to Tyburn." He was also granted a
life-interest, by way of annuity, in the pillory, where he was
adjudged to stand five days every year, as long as he lived, and where
voluntary contributions of eggs were shelled out in most unwelcome
profusion by the populace.


Parliament met on the 22nd of May, 1685, and James delivered a
speech from the throne, with notes introduced ad libitum, and a
running accompaniment of threats, remarkable for their extreme
impudence. This effrontery had its effect, for the Commons, having
retired to their chamber, voted him an income of a million and a
quarter for his life, with other contingencies which only required
asking for. The Court party supported him with zeal, and chiefly
recommended him as a king that had never broken his word, which
appears to have placed him in the light of a royal phenomenon. In
the midst of all this comfortable and complimentary confidence
<!-- Leaf 359, Page: 323 -->
between the Parliament and James, news arrived that Monmouth
had landed in the west, with a tremendous standard, round which
the mob, who will rush anywhere to see a flag fly, were rapidly
rallying. Monmouth had only got a force of one hundred men by
way of nucleus to a larger assemblage, or, in other words, as the tag
to which the string of rag and bobtail would be most likely to attach
itself. The rebellion raised by Monmouth was very soon put down,
and Monmouth himself was found cowering at the bottom of a ditch,
in the mud of which he must have expired, had it not been for an
opponent of his dy-nasty, who would not leave him to die in such a
very disagreeable manner. Poor Monmouth was taken, tried, and
condemned; and not to be out of fashion, he gave money to the headsman
—thus paying the costs of his own execution even upon the scaffold.


James proceeded to punish all whom he believed to be the enemies
of his government, with a sanguinary fury worthy of the revolutionary
tribunals of France during the ascendency of Robespierre. Colonel
Kirk, a soldier who had become savage by service at Tangier, and
who, having once tasted blood, never knew when he had had enough
of it, was sent to use the sword of war upon real or suspected
rebels, while Jeffreys hacked about him right and left with the sword
of justice. The king himself, with brutal appreciation of the judge's
ferocious career, gave it the name of "Jeffrey's campaign," and this
disgrace to the ermine inflamed by drink the natural fierceness of
his character. He hiccuped out sentences of death with an idiotic
stare of counterfeit solemnity, and he rolled about the Bench in such
a disgraceful manner, that a junior, who had nothing to do in court
but make bad jokes, observed that Jeffreys could never have acted as a
standing counsel, and it was, therefore, lucky for him that he had been
raised to a post of dignity which he could conveniently lean against.


This monster in judicial form was elevated to the office of
Lord Chancellor, with the title of Baron Wem on the death of Lord
Keeper North; when, by way of earning his promotion, Jeffreys went
hanging away at a much more rapid rate than before, and the only
misfortune was, that there was not sufficient rope for him to hang
himself, notwithstanding the abundance of that material which was
supplied to him. Jeffreys added to the trade of a butcher the less
<!-- Leaf 360, Page: 324 -->
sanguinary pursuits of bribery and corruption, which enabled him to
make a certain sum per head of the prisoners, while their heads
remained upon their shoulders. He and father Petre, the king's
confessor, divided £6000 paid by Hampden, who was still in jail, to
put aside a capital charge of high treason with which he had been
threatened; and poor Prideaux, a barrister who had talked himself
into the Tower by an unfortunate " gift of the gab," purchased
his impunity for £1500, the probable amount of his entire life's
professional earnings.


The Marquess of Halifax had sat at the council board for some
time with Rochester, who, though swearing from morning till night,
and drunk from night till morning, was the recognised head of the
high church party, and the great hope of the religious section of the
community. Halifax, not exactly liking the projects of his royal
master, and the character of his colleague, turned a little refractory;
and being dismissed from office, became in the natural order of
things the leader of the opposition. His hostility told even upon the
haughty Jeffreys, who was made to perform the unpleasant operation
of biting the dust—a fate to which those who are always opening their
mouths and showing their teeth are necessarily reduced when they
are brought to a prostrate condition. James was so much disgusted
and disappointed that he dissolved the Parliament, to avoid further
discussion, thus as it were turning off the gas by which a light was
being thrown upon his own real views and character.


The undisguised object of James was to Catholicise the whole
country by dismissing from office all who had the slightest shade of
Protestantism in their principles; and even Rochester, the head of
the high church party, having got argumentative and disputatious
over his drink, was turned out of the Council. This ejectment was
judicious in the main, though the immediate cause for it scarcely
warranted the act; but the Council Room had been little better than
a public-house parlour during the whole time that Rochester had
been suffered to sit in it. James next drew up a declaration of
liberty of conscience, to be read in all the churches, but the bishops,
with very great spirit, resisted the introduction of the obnoxious
document. They were consequently summoned on a charge of high
<!-- Leaf 361, Page: 325 -->
misdemeanor before the King's Bench, when Jeffreys tried to cajole
them with such amiable observations as " Now then, what's this
little affair r There's some mistake, is there not ? but we shall soon
put it all to rights, I dare say; "—a style of conciliation to which the
bishops did not take as kindly as the king and his creatures desired.
The people were greatly in favour of the prelates, who were cheered
on their way to their trial by an enthusiastic mob of juveniles; for it
is worthy of remark, that the boys are ever in advance of their age,
as the pioneers of popular opinion.


The jury, having in their own hearts an echo to the general voice,
acquitted the defendants, after an adjournment and a locking up for a
night, which had been rendered necessary by the obstinacy of a Mr.
Arnold, the king's brewer, who supplied the palace with beer, and
insisted upon putting what he called " nice pints," for the purpose of
raising difficulties in the minds of his colleagues. A verdict of "Not
Guilty " was however eventually returned, and a round of applause
having started in the Court itself, passed from group to group till it
got to Temple Bar, where the porters taking it up with terrific force,
gave it a lift down Fleet Street, and it was thence forwarded by easy
stages as far as the Tower. London was illuminated in honour of
the occasion, and the Pope having been hanged in effigy, some wag
put " a light in his laughing eye," which caused it to twinkle for a
few moments, until, like the fire of genius, it consumed the frame in
which it was deposited.


On the 10th of June, 1688, the queen, Mary d'Este, the second
wife of James, was declared to have been delivered of a " fine
bouncing boy," but the people, who would have no Papist heir to the
throne, declared the alleged "bouncing boy" to be a bounce
altogether. There was not over nicety in the mode chosen to
account for the presence of the child, by those who would not
believe that it was the son of the king and queen; but the most
popular story was, that the little fellow had been brought in a
warming-pan into the royal bedchamber. This was hauling the
young Pretender rather prematurely over the coals, but as the
contents of the warming-pan were never regularly sifted, we cannot
vouch for the truth or falsehood of the account that has been handed
<!-- Leaf 362, Page: 326 -->
down to us. The event, whether real or fictitious, was celebrated by
a brilliant display of fireworks, which proved a sad failure; for the
lightning, which was exceedingly vivid, completely took the shine
out of the feu dartifice, and thoroughly " paled," as if with a pail of
cold water, " their ineffectual fires."


All eyes were now turned upon William, Prince of Orange, who,
naturally enough, became as proud as a peacock at having so many
eyes upon him. Having received a very pressing invitation from
England, he determined to come over and question the legitimacy of
the alleged Prince of Wales—our young friend of the warming-pan.
On Friday, October 16, 1688, William of Orange set sail, and stood
over for the English coast; but old Boreas, who stands as sentinel
over the British Isles, began railing and blustering in such a
boisterous manner, that the invading fleet was driven out of its
course, and the order on board every ship was to " ease her," " back
her," or " turn her astarn," to prevent a collision that might have
proved disagreeable. The fleet, however, sailed definitively on the
1st of November, and arriving at Torbay on the 4th, he landed there
amid the usual kissing of hands, grasping of legs, hanging on at the
coat tails, and tugging affectionately at the cloak skirts, which form
the ordinary demonstrations of affectionate loyalty towards any new
object, who can bid tolerably high for it. Nevertheless, the people
did not come out half so strongly as he could have desired; and,
indeed, he complained that the warmth of his first reception had soon
cooled down to mere politeness with the chill off. It is said that he
even threatened to return, but recollecting that such quick returns
would be productive of no profit, he abandoned the notion of going
home, and said to himself, very sensibly, "Well, well! now I am
here, I suppose I must makethe best of it."


James was completely taken aback at the news of what had
occurred, and tried to get up a little bit of popularity by turning
quack doctor and running about in all directions to touch people for
the king's evil. It was, however, a mere piece of claptrap, or, as
some term it, touch and go; for directly the people had been touched
they were found to go without evincing the smallest symptoms of
attachment to their doctor and master. James had certainly got a
<!-- Leaf 363, Page: 327 -->
considerable number of soldiers; but he could not rely upon them for
three reasons—first, because they were not to be trusted; secondly,
because they were not to be depended upon; and thirdly, because
there was no reliance to be placed upon them. Any one of these
causes would of itself have been sufficient; but James was almost as
difficult of conviction as the celebrated angler, who only abandoned
his fishing expedition upon finding that there were, in the first place,
no fish; secondly, that he had no fishing-rod; and thirdly, that if
there were any fish, he did not think they would allow him to
catch them.


The soldiers soon began to justify James's doubt of their fidelity,
by rapidly deserting him. Lord Colchester went first, and the
example was so catching that it ran through all the forces, and when
James made up his mind to join the army, he made the mortifying
discovery that there was nothing to join, for all the officers were
unattached to the cause of the sovereign. The bishops advised him
to call a Parliament, and the little Prince of Wales was packed off in
a parcel, with " This side upwards " legibly inscribed on the crown
of his hat, to Portsmouth. In the midst of his other distresses, the
king's nose began to bleed, in consequence, it was said, of the
repeated blows he had endured from the soldiery, who had flown in
his face with the utmost disloyalty. He consequently made up his
mind and his portmanteau to retreat, when, in stopping at Andover,
he asked his son-in-law, Prince George of Denmark, and the young
Duke of Ormond, to sup with him. They accepted the invitation;
but in the morning they were both missing, having run off—without
paying their bills—to join the Prince of Orange, whom they found in
quarters. On arriving at Whitehall, James found that even his
daughter Anne had followed her husband's example and joined
the enemy.


As every one else was flying, James began to think that it was
high time for himself to run for it. The little Prince of Wales, who
had been forwarded to Portsmouth, was actually declined as a parcel
on which the carriage had not been paid, and was sent back like a
returned letter to London. The queen, putting the little fellow under
her arm, walked over Westminster Bridge, popped into the Gravesend
<!-- Leaf 364, Page: 328 -->
coach, and hailed a yacht, which took her and her infant to Calais.
James, only waiting to pocket the great seal, ran after his wife; but
finding the bauble heavy, and that the great seal, by making him
look conspicuous, would perhaps seal his doom, he pitched it into the
river. On reaching Lambeth they exclaimed " Hoy, a hoy! " and a
hoy was provided in which he took his passage; but the vessel
putting in at the Isle of Sheppy for ballast, the people attacked him
with great rudeness, and called him, without knowing who he was,
a "hatchet-faced Jesuit." This proves he must have had a very sharp
expression, for with a face like a hatchet, he would no doubt have had
teeth like a saw, and presented altogether a rather formidable aspect.


To save himself from outrage he announced himself as the king,
but this disclosure had only the effect of making them rob as well as
insult him, for knowing he had money of his own, they were
determined to get it out of him. He was seized by a mob offish-women,
sailors, and smugglers, who turned his pockets inside out, and bullied
him so severely that he howled out piteously for mercy, and adopted a
favourite oath of his brother Charles's, when a salmon lighting rather
heavily on his eye, he exclaimed " Odds fish ! " with considerable
earnestness. He at length "put up" at the nearest public house,
where he wrote a note to Lord Winchilsea. Upon the arrival of this
nobleman, the king sat down and had a good cry, but Winchilsea
sagaciously observed to him, "Come, come; it's no use taking on so;
you had much better take yourself off as speedily as possible."


The moment the flight of James from his palace was known, the
city was thrown into the utmost excitement, and by way of making
each other more nervous than need be, the inhabitants set all the
bells ringing with incessant vehemence. The people might have
knocked each other down with feathers, so agitated had they become;
and in their frenzy they not only began burning all the popish
chapels, but looked everywhere for Father Petre to make the same
use of him that his namesake saltpetre might have been turned to on
such a very explosive occasion. Father Petre had taken himself off
to France, but the pope's nuncio, who was in general denounced by
the mob, disguised himself as a footman, and kept jumping up
behind a carriage, to look as if he was in service, whenever he observed
<!-- Leaf 365, Page: 329 -->
anyone apparently watching him with suspicion. Judge Jeffreys
having been stupidly intoxicated over some sittings in banco at a
public house, followed by a trial at bar of some cream gin that had
been strongly recommended to his lordship for mixing, was unable of
course to fly—or even to stand—but, disguised as a sailor, he was
perambulating the streets of Wapping. Having been discovered, he
was seized by the mob, who, instead of exercising a summary
jurisdiction, and hanging him at once, as they might have done had they
determined to pay him in his own coin, turned him over to the Lord
Mayor as a preliminary to a regular trial.


A provisional government of the bishops and peers was formed in
London, and a note despatched to the Prince of Orange, saying, " that
the first time he came that way, if he would drop in they should
be very happy to see him." James showed considerable obstinacy
before he could be got rid of; and he continued exercising, as long
as he could, some of the smaller functions of royalty. He came
back to London, and to the surprise of everybody, sat down to
dinner as usual at Whitehall, forgetting, perhaps, that his father
had taken a chop there on a previous occasion for having given
offence to his people.


Four battalions of the Dutch Guards were marched into
Westminster by way of hint, which James for some time refused to take,
and he had actually gone to bed, when Halifax roused him up, by the
information that he must start off to Ham, as the Prince of Orange
was expected at Whitehall the first thing in the morning. James
observed, that the place suggested to him was very chilly, and as he
could not bear cold Ham, he had much rather go to Rochester, if it
was all the same to Halifax. This was agreed to on behalf of the
Prince of Orange; and James, taking the Gravesend boat, quitted
London with a very few followers. There was an explosion of
Cockney sentimentality on this occasion; for the citizens who had
been the first to demand his expulsion, began shedding tears in
tea-cupfuls when they witnessed the departure of the sovereign.


Having remained for the night at Gravesend, he started the next
morning for Rochester, and after a very brief stay, he went in a
fishing-smack, smack across the Channel to Ambleteuse, a small town  
  
  
  VOL. II. U U
<!-- Leaf 366, Page: 330 -->
in Picardy. From thence he hastened to the Court of Louis XIV.,
where James still enjoyed the empty title of king, which was not
the only empty thing he possessed, for his pockets were in the
same condition until Louis replenished them. He sometimes
compared them to a couple of exhausted non-receivers, for these were
utterly exhausted, and were not in the receipt of anything but what
he obtained from his brother sovereign's munificence. Some
historians tell us that James had made a purse, but if he had, it is
doubtful whether he had any money remaining to stock it with, after
the fishermen, who made all fish that came to their net, had
encountered him at Torbay, and deprived him of all the loose cash he
had about him.


William of Orange could not exactly make up his mind what to
do upon the flight of James; but he very wisely declined to follow
the advice of some injudicious friends, who recommended him to
appear in the character of William the Conqueror. He sagaciously
observed that imitations were always bad, evincing an utter absence
of any original merit in the imitator, and certain in the end to have
their hollowness detected. He admitted that the idea of entering
England as William the Conqueror might have been a very good
one at first; but that he should very justly be denounced as an
impudent humbug if he endeavoured to obtain popularity by trading
on the reputation of another. Scorning, therefore, to be a servile
copyist, he determined on striking out a path for himself, and tried
the " moderately constitutional dodge," which succeeded so well
that he is to this day recognised as the hero of what is termed the
\"glorious Revolution."


He called together some members of Charles II.'s Parliaments,
and recommended them, with the assistance of the Lord Mayor and
forty Common Councilmen, to consider what had better be done
under the peculiar circumstances of the nation. There is something
richly ludicrous, according to modern notions, in the idea of
consulting a Lord Mayor and fifty Common Councilmen on a great
political question; for though we would cheerfully be guided by such
authorities in the choice of a sirloin of beef or the framing of a bill
of fare, their views on the cooking up of a constitution would not,

in these days, be gravely listened to. The peers and bishops had
already recommended the summoning of a convention, and the Lord
{empty}.Mayor having proposed that the Commons should say " ditto to
that," the suggestion was forthwith adopted.


The Convention having met, the first question it proceeded to
discuss was, whether James had not, in leaving the kingdom, run
away, in fact, from his creditors, for every king owes a debt to his
people; and whether the throne, crown, and sceptre, might not be
seized for the benefit of those to whom he was under liabilities. The
Commons soon came to the resolution that the throne was vacant,
a conclusion which we must not examine too strictly; for if the
principle involved in it were to be generally admitted, we should
find that a freeholder running away from his freehold house to
avoid meeting his Christmas bills, would, by that act, not only oust
himself from his property, but cut off all his successors from their
right of inheritance.


Upon the broad and vulgar principle that the Stuarts were a bad
lot, the Convention was justified perhaps in changing the succession to
the throne; but, for our own parts, we must confess our disinclination
to let in such a plea for the wholesale setting aside of a reigning
family. As the last of the Pretenders is happily defunct, we may
venture upon taking the line of argument we have adopted, without
running the risk of a public meeting being called on the appearance
of these pages, to consider the immediate restoration of the Stuarts,
a measure which our loyalty to the reigning sovereign, who
fortunately unites in her own person all claims to the crown, would
never tolerate. Had it been otherwise, we should not have been
surprised by the announcement of a league, with the usual staff of a
chairman, a boy, a brass plate, and a bell, to restore to the house of
Stuart the crown of England.


To return, however, to William of Orange, whom we left waiting
to be asked to walk up the steps of the throne; and we have great
pleasure in taking him by the hand, for the purpose of giving him a
lift to that exalted station he was now called to occupy. Some were
for engaging him as regent during the minority of the Prince of
<!-- Leaf 368, Page: 332 -->
Wales; but William flatly refused to become a warming-pan for one
whose alleged introduction into the royal bed-chamber through the
medium of a warming-pan, rendered the simile at once striking and
appropriate. " All or none," was the motto adopted by William in
his negotiations with the Convention, and it was at length resolved
to settle the crown on the joint heads of himself and the Princess of
Orange, with a stipulation that the Prince should hold the reins of
government. A declaration of rights was drawn up, so that
everything was reduced to writing, and put down in black and white, for
the purpose of avoiding disputes between the king and the people.


James's reign was now hopelessly at an end, and entirely by his
own act; for, after he had absconded, it would have been idle for the
nation to have been satisfied with writing, " Gone away; not known
where," over the throne of England. A sketch of the character of
this king is scarcely required from the English historian, who may
fairly say, " My former man, James, quitted my service, and you had
better make inquiries in his last place, for I have ceased to have
anything to do with him. I can venture to say he was sober; but I
am not quite sure about his honesty; for though in looking over the
plate-basket where I kept the regalia, I found the crown, sceptre, and
other articles of that description perfectly right, I had missed from
time to time a great deal of money, which I verily believe the man
James had pocketed. I should say that the fellow was very weak,
and not being strong enough for his place, he left his work a great
deal to inferior servants, who behaved very shamefully. I think the
fellow was willing, and it might be said of him, that he would if he
could, but he couldn't—a state in which the servant of a nation is not
likely to give much satisfaction to those who require his services."


Such is the character that may be fairly written of James II.,
who, we may as well add, was promoted to a saintdom in France, by
way of compensation for his forfeiture of the " right divine to govern
wrong " in England.

-*■■ sink the historian for a
time in the reviewer, and to
take a retrospect of the
literature of the period through
which our narrative has passed.
The republic of politics was
not favourable to the republic
of letters, and the Elizabethan
dramatists were followed by a
few playwrights, of a very
inferior class. The mantle of

great deal too large. Denham and Waller, those two commonplace
songsters, set up a faint warbling, and Hobbes had sufficient fire to
burn with philosophic ardour, though his thoughts were fettered by
his royalist principles. Hobbes, however, was a fireside companion
to many, though they dared scarcely hang over Hobbes in the
broad light of day. Milton had written little till he gave to the world
—which is true enough, for the world can hardly be said to have
bought it—his "Paradise Lost," which he brought out in 1667, and
though the sale was limited, it was sufficiently encouraging to induce
him to baffle the crowd of imitators by advertising a new poem, to be
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P369_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 370, Page: 334 -->
  
  called " Paradise Regained." He feared the sort of impertinent
opposition which echoes every new work, and which, when an original
writer takes it into his head to bid anyone " Go where the aspens
quiver," "Meet him in the willow-glen," or commit some other foolery,
will reply by expressing a desire to come where the aspens are
actually quivering, and to be punctual at the willow-glen, for which
the invitation is forwarded. " Paradise Regained" had the fate of
all merely imitative literature, for it never acquired, and will never
attain, the reputation its prototype or predecessor has enjoyed.


The Restoration seemed to act as a restorative to Milton's
powers, for he published many of his finest things after Charles II.
returned to the throne. Cowley was one of the earliest writers who
took to diluting the works of other people in some stuff of his own;
and, taking the materials of Donne, he set an example of the modern
practice of seizing upon another man's original ideas, for the
purpose of beating or spinning them out into a shape that may, if
possible, prevent the real authorship from being recognised. There
was, however, a great deal of true genius among the literary men of
the age, through which our narrative has just carried us. Spenser,
whose tales were only too short, would have been sufficient to
redeem the period from the imputation of mediocrity.


The Stage was, during the reign of Charles H., in a very degraded
state; but the cry for the restoration of the drama has been kept up
so long, that we really do not know what there is to restore, if
everything has been always bad, except the works of two or three
writers, whose productions are being so constantly performed, that
the public cannot reasonably complain of not getting enough of them.
The "palmy days of dramatic literature" are, according to the
ordinary acceptation of those who use the term, any days but the
present, and it is not improbable that our own will be looked back
upon and lamented as the genuine " palmy days " by the generation
of grumblers who may come after us. If everything is objected to in
its turn—and such has been the fate of every successive crop of
writings for the Stage—we of course cannot tell with accuracy what
it would be considered worth while to restore in the judgment of
those who are clamorous for the restoration of the drama. There is
<!-- Leaf 371 -->
  
  Sir Isaac Newton,  
  
  
  ■t t c
ooo

Chap. V]

also considerable difference of opinion as to how the restoration is to
be effected; and we may perhaps be excused, therefore, for suggesting
that some good strong salts—attic salts, of course—are likely to prove
the most effectual restoratives to a drama in a languishing condition.


There was an immense increase in the family of science at or
about the period we have been speaking of, and indeed science had
so many sons, that it would not have been very surprising if the fate
of the domestic circle of the old lady who lived in a shoe—namely,
an abundance of broth and a scarcity of bread—had been their
inheritance. The illustrious Boyle might frequently have been left
without a roast by the number of competitors who were seeking a
living round him through the exercise of their talents, and amidst
his curious experiments on air, that of trying to live upon it might,
if successful, have been of the greatest use to him. He was an
enthusiast in the splendid career he had long and perseveringly
pursued; nor is it going beyond the truth to say of him, that he
combined extatics with hydrostatics, by the eagerness and animation
with which he threw himself into water, whose properties were
almost the only property he ever realised. There were several other
scientific luminaries in this age, and we must not forget Hooke, who
always had an eye to the capabilities of the microscope, and took an
enlarged view of everything that fell under his observation.


For Sydenham, the restorer of true physic, we have not so much
veneration; but Newton is a name that we cannot pass over so
slightingly. This great man, to whom science was the apple of his eye, and
to whose eye the apple had revealed one of the greatest truths ever
discovered, lived for some time a most retired life, which he passed
in tranquil obscurity. Such was his position when the fruits of his
contemplation came home to him in the shape of a golden pippin,
which he revolved in his mind as it revolved in the air, and the
result was, the great fact by the perception of which his name has
been immortalised. Though Newton was a pattern of modesty in
his intercourse with the external world, he was bold enough in his
approaches to Dame Nature, and would not allow her to hide her
face from him, if by any amount of perseverance he could get a peep
at it. He even had the audacity to go the length of tearing off her
<!-- Leaf 372, Page: 336 -->
veil, for the purpose of revealing her beauties; and Nature instead of
becoming indignant at this rough treatment, was evidently flattered
by his attentions, to which she offered every encouragement.


It is a curious fact, that the Institution of the Royal Society
commenced under the auspices of a brother-in-law of Cromwell, one
Wilkins, a clergyman, who, although so nearly allied to the republican
leader, had no objection to accept facilities from a regal hand for
promoting the objects of science, in which he felt a zealous interest.
This brother-in-law of Cromwell was Bishop of Chester under the
Restoration, which he liked just as well as the Commonwealth, and
perhaps better, for his mitre was rather safer under a royal rule, than
it could have been during a republican government.


Charles II. was without doubt a lover of the sciences to a certain
extent; but his disgusting depravities left him neither money nor time
for the advancement of genius and literary merit. His contemporary,
Louis XIV., was more liberal of his bounty to those whose intellect
formed their chief claim to consideration; but even this magnificent
monarch scarcely devoted to literature, science, and art, as much as
he often lavished on one worthless courtier. It is, however, a matter
for humiliation and regret that we have not advanced upon the
munificence of Charles II. and Louis XIV.; for, notwithstanding all
the acknowledgment that talent in these days receives by way of
personal consideration and respect, a few paltry thousands a year form
the whole amount that the nation will afford to pension its instructors
or entertainers, when their powers of instruction and entertainment
have failed to afford them the means of comfortable livelihood. Of
the condition of the people during the period described in the few last
chapters, we had rather say very little, as we can say nothing
complimentary. Hypocrisy, during the Commonwealth, and unbridled
licentiousness at the Restoration, were the characteristic features of
the two divisions of a period which cast upon the respectability of
the nation a blot, that time has only turned to iron-mould. The fame
of a nation, like a damask table-cloth, when once stained, is never
thoroughly restored; for, send them both to the wash—immersing the
former in the tears of regret, and the latter in the soap-suds—the stain
is still indelibly there, beyond the power of pearl-ash or penitence.

they would put their names to it.
This document was a Declaration of
Rights, in which it was asserted that
"elections ought to be free," that
\"jurors ought to be duly empannelled
and returned," besides a number of
those " oughts" which are highly
respected at the commencement of a

reign, but frequently stand for nothing before the end of it. The
Prince of Orange was by no means so squeezable as his name would
seem to imply, for he refused to accept the crown unless he could
have the power as well as the name of king, and he stipulated that
his wife should have no share in the government. He probably
knew the lady's temper pretty well, and felt that neither the country
nor himself would have had much peace had she been allowed to
interfere, and indeed it was a saying of one of the ancients, whose
name we have not been able to learn, that " when a woman rules
the roast, a quantity of broils may be looked for." He threatened to

<!-- Leaf 376, Page: 340 -->
return to Holland if Parliament gave his wife any share of his
authority, and the once popular but now almost obsolete menace of
\"If you do I'm a Dutchman," * originated no doubt in the
intimation of William that he would cut his English connections, and
return to his Dutch duchy if his views were thwarted by his
adopted countrymen.


A country in want of a king is naturally prone to accept one upon
almost any terms; and though England might have been very
particular in ordinary circumstances about its chief magistrate, there
was so much unpleasantness in being without a person of the sort,
that the nation was very anxious to suit itself. William's
stipulations were therefore listened to, and it was even arranged that Mary,
in whose right alone he had any claim on the British Crown, should
have but a nominal share of it. The Commons voted that James
had abdicated; or, in other words, bolted, and thereby shut himself
out; while the Lords resolved that the throne was vacant; and thus
by two different modes they came to the same conclusion, namely,
that there was an opening for anyone to " step up," if the terms
were agreed upon. After some negotiation it was arranged that
William should take the vacant situation, which should be
considered to some extent a single-handed place, though nominally
filled by " a man and his wife," it being understood that the former
should do all the work, and that the latter should make herself
generally useless.


It will naturally occur to the curious reader to inquire what has
become of the fugitive James, and we shall therefore commission
our research to set out as a policeman in pursuit of him. We first
trace him to Versailles, where he met with a very friendly
reception from Louis XIV., who made him as comfortable as
circumstances would admit, and lent him a lot of French soldiers to play
at an invasion with.


Ireland was then, as it has been always, our weakest point, and it
was resolved that James should hit us on that unhappy raw, which


* The insertion of this rare old saying is rather intended to display our own
reading than with any idea of its being absolutely essential to the narrative.
<!-- Leaf 377, Page: 341 -->
all our attempts to heal have only tended to aggravate. James
repaired to Brest, where he found himself in the bosom of a
ragamuffin crowd of exiles; and forming the best of these into a sort of
army, he landed with a force of about 2500 at Kinsale. Having
taken the English by surprise, James's party obtained a bit of a
victory at Bantry Bay, for the numbers of the former being
comparatively few, their Commander, Admiral Herbert, thought it would

be sheer folly not to sheer off, and he made for Scilly, which he
acknowledged to a friend was exceedingly ridiculous. James made
the most of the opportunity, and summoned an Irish Parliament,
which, with true Irish generosity, began voting away money at a
tremendous rate before it came in, and had bestowed upon James
twenty thousand a month out of nothing a year, within the few first
days of their sitting.


The Treasury was of course not in a condition to meet the
liberal orders that were made upon it, and James had no means of
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P377_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 378, Page: 342 -->
replenishing it, except with what he brought over in his pocket from
France, and this, though it had come some distance, would not go
very far, when he began to try the experiment. Having a scarcity of
gold and silver, he determined to try the effect of brass, which he knew
to be in many cases a perfect substitute for both the precious metals,
and he ordered that his brazen coinage should pass for a hundred
times its value, which has furnished a monumentum ære perennius of
his brazen impudence. His household was poverty-stricken in the
extreme, and Black Rod had nothing but an old birch as the emblem
of his office. The Court was, in fact, rendered as bad as the lowest
alley by the turmoils and turbulence that prevailed in consequence
of the shortness of cash, and after some little hesitation, James
determined to go to Londonderry for ammunition to carry on the war;
but on his arrival the only powder and shot he received, came to him
in the shape of the firing of the garrison. Finding the place—or
rather the inhabitants—unwilling to surrender, James drew off, and
arrived in Dublin, where some of the famous Dublin stout in the
shape of a few stalwart adherents still sustained him in his enterprise.


William had no doubt a very troublesome part to play, for he was
surrounded by a discontented set, which must always arise upon a
change of dynasty, when the good things to be given away form a
proportion of about one-eighth per cent.—or half-a-crown in the
hundred pounds—to the expectations of the would-be recipients.
When a plan is fixed upon for dividing a thousand pounds into fifty
thousand equal shares of a hundred thousand pounds each, there will
be some probability that the promoters of a revolution will, when the
revolution is complete, be all equally and perfectly satisfied. William
was speedily surrounded by a number of adherents to his cause, who
had stuck to it with the leech-like intention of drawing upon it to
the fullest possible extent; and his hangers-on were consequently
more weakening to him than othenvise. On the 19th of October he
opened the second session of his first Parliament, and was soon
pestered by the pecuniary importunities of the Princess Anne of
Denmark, who declared that her income was scarcely enough to keep
her in gloves and Denmark satin slippers; and that she must have
seventy thousand pounds a-year settled upon her, quite independent
<!-- Leaf 379, Page: 343 -->
of her brother-in-law and her sister. A family quarrel ensued upon
this demand, and Queen Mary insisted that " Nancy must be mad "
to prefer a request so shamefully exorbitant. The matter was
eventually compromised, by a settlement of fifty thousand a-year on
\"Sister Anne," who was completely under the influence of Churchill,
now Earl of Marlborough.


In the beginning of 1690, William dissolved the Parliament; and
a new one met on the 20th of March, when the King announced his
intention of going to Ireland, and intimated his necessity for cash to
enable him to undertake the journey. He requested the assistance
of the Commons in settling the amount of his revenue, upon which
he proposed to borrow a considerable sum, thus acting on the
dangerous and unprofitable system of drawing a salary in advance and
spending to-day what will not come to-morrow. He intended, in
fact, to eat his pudding first, and to have it afterwards, or rather to
eat his own, and then come down upon that of other people to supply
the deficiency. The Commons, instead of checking this improvidence,
granted him two millions and two hundred thousand pounds, which
was presented to William in the shape of an elegant extract from the
pockets of his people. Money was not all that the new king required,
for he was anxious to cement his power, and like all those who feel
the doubtful character of their claims, was continually insisting on
their being formally recognised. Bills were passed, though not
without some difficulty, abjuring James and his title to the Crown; but
some nobles objected to take the oaths, and Lord Wharton, who was
a very old man, declared he was unwilling to go swearing on to the
end of his days, that " he had taken so many affidavits, he scarcely
knew one from the other, and he must beg to be excused from any
more oath-taking during the brief remainder of his existence."


The Parliament having served its purpose, in a pecuniary point
of view, was prorogued rather early, and William started for Ireland.
Previous to the king's departure, the queen very reasonably
suggested that as he could not take the royal authority away with
him, it would be a great deal like the dog in the manger, if he
refused to let her have the enjoyment of the sovereign power during
his brief absence. With some reluctance he consented to the
<!-- Leaf 380, Page: 344 -->
arrangement, observing coarsely, that he knew she would make a
mess of it, but as he should not be gone very long, it did not much
signify. With this surly concession, having agreed to a temporary
transfer of the sceptre into her grasp, he quitted her, with the
discouraging and discourteous words, "There, take it! and let all  
  
  
  
Awkward HlBtake.

the world see how right I was in preventing you from having a hand
in the use of it."


On his arrival at Belfast he began to look about him for James,
whose army was at length pounced upon on the banks of the Boyne,
and a battle became unavoidable. William was looking about him,
when the enemy, loading two immense field-pieces, aimed them both
at him; but, as between two stools, one often goes to the ground;
so, between two cannon balls, one may occasionally come off without
injury. William, when he saw the balls bouncing by him, may have
thought that he was lucky in escaping a ball'd head, but he soon
received a real wound on the shoulder, which positively tore his coat,
and grazed the skin, to the utter horror of Lord Coningsby, who
stuffed his pocket-handkerchief into the sleeve, to staunch the blood,
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P380_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 381, Page: 345 -->
that might have been, but, fortunately, was not, flowing. William
was more frightened than hurt, and his officers were more frightened
than William, while the enemy were more frightened than either, and
allayed their trepidation by giving out that William was certainly
dead, which we need not say was a mere penny-a-line report,
without the smallest foundation. A poultice soon set his shoulder to
rights, and at all events enabled him to put it to the wheel, which he
did, by calling a meeting of the officers at nine in the evening. He
told them he should cross the river the next day, and he gave orders
about their dress, observing to them playfully, that as they would
have to pass through the tide, they had better make themselves as
tidy as possible. Hearing that the enemy wore cockades, made of
white paper, he remarked that he would not have his men in such
foolscaps, but that he desired to see them all with green boughs in
their hats; and in this veryguyish guise the soldiers of William met
the adherents of James in combat.


The gallant Duke of Schomberg, who was extremely touchy, had
been somehow or other offended at the Council of War, and had
retired in a huff to his tent, exclaiming pettishly, " Settle it yourselves
how you like, for it seems I'm nobody." In vain did some of his
comrades call after him, " Schomberg, Schomberg! Come back,
come back ! " for the general withdrew within his quarters, and
letting down his camp-curtains, sat smoking his pipe with
interjectional mutterings to himself on that fruitful topic to a gentleman
in the sulks—"The obstinacy of some people."


The order of battle being formed, a copy of it was sent to him,
when, snatching it from the messenger with a loud " Umph ! " he
declared that he had scarcely made up his mind whether he should
obey or light his pipe with the document. Having looked at it,
however, the old soldier gave a whistle of satisfaction as if in ardent
anticipation of the work before him; and putting on his armour as
coolly as if he had been dressing for dinner, he made his way to the
spot appointed for the coming contest. His reception by his
sovereign and his fellow-soldiers was cheerful if not cordial; but it was
evident by the twinkle of the veteran's eye, that Schomberg was
\"himself again " when he stood in the presence of an enemy.

<!-- Leaf 382, Page: 346 -->

The contending forces having a river between them, found their
ardour a great deal damped, for it is not easy to be valorous with
the water up to one's waist, and with every desire on both sides to
make a splash, the soldiers could only dabble in hostilities without
plunging deeply into them. William put his nag boldly across the
stream, but the English had to deplore the loss of the gallant old
Duke of Schomberg, who, there is too much reason to believe, was
killed in mistake by one of his own men, though, we must confess,
we always look with very great suspicion on these so-called
accidents. James had taken his station at a most respectable
distance from danger during the whole of the affray, and he no
sooner saw that he had lost the day than he determined not to lose
a minute in making his escape from England. He galloped on
horseback to Dublin, hastened to Waterford, and embarked for
France with a wretched retinue. William returned to England,
and sent the Duke of Marlborough to Ireland, who reduced several
places, and by putting the screw upon Cork, made it pull out
very handsomely.


The bishops now began to feel very uncomfortable about their
allegiance, and to doubt the validity of its transfer from James to
William, though the truth seems to be that they had not found the
transfer fee so large as they had expected. Several were deprived of
their temporalities—the surest way of bringing them to their senses;
but there were numerous instances of disinterestedness, in which a
blindness to the advantages of the see was honourably conspicuous.


William troubled himself comparatively little about what was
going on at home, but was far more anxious to carry on with success
the league against France; and to further this object he repaired to the
Continent, where a warfare of a rather paltry character was persisted
in. The hostilities, though of a contemptible kind, were sufficiently
costly to render it necessary for William to return in the course of a
few months, and ask for more money from the English Parliament.
Large grants were made, but not without a great deal of grumbling,
for John Bull always pays, though he parts with his money very
reluctantly, and sometimes takes out half its value in surly
remonstrances against being compelled to put his hand into his pocket.
<!-- Leaf 383 -->

<!-- Leaf 385, Page: 347 -->
The general discontent was considerably aggravated by a necessity
for the revival of the odious poll-tax, which was a regular rap on the
head to all except paupers, children, and servants; for with these
exceptions everybody—or rather every head—was charged so much
a quarter for the privilege of remaining on its owner's shoulders.


William continued riding backwards and forwards between
England and Holland, but he paid the former the compliment of
making it his purse on every occasion. His Majesty was constantly
taking abroad with him both money and men, the former being
invariably spent and the latter severely wounded, before the king
came home again. Occasionally some impression was made on a
French fort, but the damage done to the enemy cost more than it was
worth to the English, whose patience and pockets continued to be
taxed for the continental freaks of the foreign king they had
permitted to rule over them. There were some able leaders on the side
of the British, and among the most conspicuous may be cited Sir
Cloudesley Shovel, who threw fresh coals on to the fire of enthusiasm
that occasionally burned up among the English.


It would be wearisome to make a list of the various journeys of
William to the Continent and back; nor, indeed, would the
document amount to anything more interesting than a time-table, were
we to take the trouble of preparing it. His people might with reason
have complained that they never saw anything of him, unless he
wanted something from them, and at length on the 12th of
November, 1694, when William condescended to meet his parliament and
request the favour of five millions to " carry on the war," the
opposition led by Mr. Harley, the statesman,—not the low comedian
—forced upon his Majesty's acceptance a bill for the summoning of
triennial parliaments.


The assent he gave to this unpalatable measure, has been
attributed to the anxiety he felt on account of the dangerous illness of
his wife, which may very naturally have incapacitated him for any
serious resistance to a demand which Parliament urged with
wonderful unanimity and energy. Poor Mary was seized with an attack of
the small-pox, and it is a curious mark of the unfeeling character of
<!-- Leaf 386, Page: 348 -->
the punsters of that happily remote age, that her malady was made
the subject of a pun, which as it was new at the period of which we
are writing, we may be allowed for the three thousand and
eightyfourth time to chronicle.


When it was known that her Majesty had caught the small-pox,
or rather that the small-pox had caught her Majesty, it was
remarked with a savageness that loses none of its ferocity from the
fact of its being a bitter truth, that she was "very much to be
pitted." Whether the queen ever heard this unfeeling and
povertystricken joke, the chroniclers do not relate, and we cannot answer
with certainty for its having been the death of her; but, as she actually
died, the supposition we have suggested is exceedingly feasible.


She expired on the 28th of December, 1694, in the thirty-third
year of her age, to the great grief of her husband, and the regret
of the nation in general; for though she was not particularly
beloved either by one or the other during her life, there was a decent
show of sorrow on the part of both, at losing her. William no doubt
felt the bereavement in more ways than one, for he had a servant the
less to wait upon him, a dependant the less to bully, and a subject the
less to domineer over. He lamented her less as a partner and friend
than he missed her as a companion and housekeeper. She was
certainly a devoted wife, but the devotion of a woman to her
husband's interests is, after all, only a second selfishness which, when
viewed in a proper light, is far more prudent than respectable. Her
inveterate dislike of her sister, with whom she refused to be
reconciled even on her death-bed, convinces us that it was not altogether a
warmth of heart that bound her to her husband; and we therefore
set her down as a cold, unfeeling person, who could sacrifice all other
ties for the sake of one which she believed to he of the most
importance to her interests.


We should not, however, be doing justice to the character of
Mary if we were to omit to state that she was exceedingly skilful in
the use of the needle, and by working curious devices on chairs or
carpets, she in one way at least set a pattern to the female portion of
the community.

lord-keeper, whose reception was not by any means as mild as a
summer's day, and who congratulated himself on having the royal
conscience rather than the royal temper in his keeping. The keeper,
however, was determined to keep it up, and so importuned William
to be reconciled to Anne, that his Majesty ultimately roared out
\"Do as you like, but don't bother me, for I'm not fit for business, nor
indeed for anything." Somers arranged an interview between Sister
Anne and the King, who gave her St. James's Palace as a residence,
and a quantity of the jewels, which the late Queen, whom he called
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P387_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 388, Page: 350 -->
his " duck of diamonds," had left behind her. The Marlboroughs, who
had gone quite out of favour with the King, but were the right and
left hand of Anne, expected to have a share of the reconciliation,
and an interest in its proceeds.


Early in 1695, a glut of unpaid washing-bills which were floating
about the neighbourhood of all the barracks, threw a doubt on the
honesty, or at all events on the prudence, of the soldiery; and it was
determined by the government that an enquiry should be made into
the causes of this paltry irregularity. The disgraceful discovery
was instantly arrived at, that the soldiers could not pay their scores
because the gallant fellows had not received their salaries.


Corruption and bribery of the lowest kind in the highest quarters
were soon brought to light, and it was proved that the secretary of
the treasury had taken a large percentage on the money he had to
pay, as a sort of bonus for giving himself the trouble to hand it over.
Sir John Trevor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, turned out
a shocking old rogue, and was found to have been in the habit of
receiving bribes for putting questions from the chair, or for smuggling
measures through their various stages. He had, in fact, undertaken
to get bills done for anyone who brought him a tempting douceur,
and a sum of a thousand guineas was distinctly traced to the pocket
of the venerable knave from the promoters of the Orphans' Bill. He
was punished by being compelled to put from the chair of the House
the resolution that he, Sir John Trevor, was unworthy of sitting in
the House, and deserved to be kicked out of it. The "Ayes"
decidedly had it, and Sir John Trevor would have had it too, if he
had not instantly withdrawn, to avoid the unpleasantness of forcible
ejection. Mr. Hungerford, the chairman of the committee on the same
bill, was also accused, when yielding to a loud cry of " Turn him
out," mingled with occasional mutterings of " Throw him over," the
dis-honourable member sneaked away from the senate. A further
series of corruptions would certainly have been detected had not
William determined to avoid further scandal, or at all events further
exposure by dissolving the Parliament.  
  
  
  James was constantly urging his friend Louis to invade England,
<!-- Leaf 389, Page: 351 -->
and he was at length persuaded to collect a fleet and army on the
coast, while James himself sent over Sir George Barclay and the
Duke of Berwick to attempt an insurrection. The idea of a couple
of adventurers coming over to upset the Government was of itself
absurd, and the affair was rendered more preposterous by Barclay
having taken a lodging in Hatton Garden, where a garret formed his
place of business for conducting the affairs of the conspiracy. A
simple notification to " ring the top bell," was all that pointed out
this nest of treason to those who took an interest in its progress.
Even the modern accessories of a boy and a board-room, with a
provisional committee, a dozen chairs, and a dining-table, were wanting
to this desperate scheme, and indeed, while Barclay was away in
order to get his meals—for there was no cooking on the premises—a
recommendation to put letters through the door, and leave messages
or parcels with the porter at the lodge, formed the entire
instructions upon which the subordinate conspirators had to act when they
chanced, in the absence of their chief, to call at the chambers.


Such were the contemptible arrangements of this project for
turning the throne upside down, and burying, or at all events,
bonneting, William in the ruins of the outraged upholstery. We
cannot be surprised that its progress was not by any means
encouraging, but Barclay had heard of a plot to assassinate the king, in
which one Sir William Perkins was concerned, and thus the since
celebrated firm of Barclay and Perkins may be considered to have
originated in a partnership project for brewing the storm of revolution.
Barclay thought well of the scheme, and was introduced to one
Porter; but in those days Barclay and Perkins turned up their noses
at Porter, " who was a drunkard and a blab," and they therefore
were unwilling to put any faith in him. Barclay, however, resolved
to persevere in his regicide scheme, and applied to one Captain
Fisher, who lived in King Street, Westminster, and was understood
to be open to an offer as decidedly as if there were written over his
door, "Murders carefully performed. Assassins' work in general."


The proposal of Barclay, whatever it may have been, was not
sufficiently liberal; for Fisher would only undertake to kill one of
the royal coach-horses between Hyde Park and St. James's, but he
<!-- Leaf 390, Page: 352 -->
declined any higher responsibility at the price that was offered.
Barclay called Fisher a fool, and they never came to terms; but the
former resolved to make the attempt on William's life, and the
romantic Green of Turnham, over which the king was about to pass,
on a day appointed, was selected as the scene of the treasonable  
  
  
  
Captain Fisher doesn't think he can do It at the price.

experiment. The party of assassins had swelled to thirty-five, who
planted themselves in ambush behind some bushes, when news was
brought that the king had changed his mind, and would not come to
Turnham Green. "Which," says Burnet, "was enough to turn 'em
pale with anger and disappointment." There being some fear that
the plot would be discovered, Barclay sneaked off to France,
abandoning his fellow-conspirators to their fate, and believing that
his old companion Perkins would be nicely left in the lurch; but
by a strange coincidence, that personage had entertained a similar
notion with regard to his associate, and had got away first, so that
the recreant couple had been equally deep in their cowardice
and duplicity.
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P390_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 391, Page: 353 -->

It appeared that Fisher, who had volunteered the horrible office of
knacker upon the coach-horse of the king, disclosed to Lord Portland
the particulars of the plot, and the result was that several more of the
traitors, finding confession the order of the day, went forward to tell
not only all they knew, but a great deal more, that they had invented
for the sake of having something to communicate. This glut of
confidential intelligence was so embarrassing, that the Government did
not know what to believe or what to doubt; but nevertheless a
proclamation was issued, offering a thousand pounds and a pardon to
any gentleman involved in the scheme, who would be fool enough
to criminate himself and villain enough to betray his accomplices.
There were, of course, several candidates for the cash, and disclosures
at a thousand pounds each poured in at such a rapid rate, that it was
difficult to meet the demands made on the treasury, on account of
the news for which the Government had advertised. To make a long
story short, several were tried, found guilty, and executed, for having
shared in the treasonable design against William, and among
them was one Keys, a trumpeter, who was a mere instrument—
like his own trumpet—in the hands of anyone by whom he could
be played upon.


William's popularity increased, on account of the plots that had
been put into operation against him; for it is a beautiful trait in the
English character, that the people will become suddenly attracted
towards anyone who seems to be an object of dislike to others.
Unfortunately, however, this generosity is somewhat inconsistent in
its nature, for it is usually accompanied by an excess of illiberality
in an opposite direction, and if a man is a martyr to a spirit of
hostility, the sympathy evinced for him by the public is joined with
a savage desire to make martyrs of his enemies. Upon this principle
poor Sir John Fenwick was pounced upon for having compassed or
imagined the death of the king, and though there is every reason to
believe that such an idea was quite out of the compass of his wildest
imagination, he was brought to the scaffold.


It is doubtful, notwithstanding the fuss we now make—and indeed
have been making ever since the event—about the glorious
Revolution of 1688, whether we really had anything like full value for the  
  
  
  VOL. II. Z Z
<!-- Leaf 392, Page: 354 -->
trouble it occasioned us. However numerous the blessings we have
since derived from it, we must contend that it did not pay in the first
instance; for as long as England derived no other advantage than
having William for its king, the good achieved by the Revolution of
1688 must be considered rather more than dubious. He spent his
own time and his new country's money in sustaining his own title
against the attacks made upon it by foreign powers, whose interest
in supporting the doctrine of the " right divine of kings to govern
wrong," kept them constantly in a state of active sympathy with
James, whose misconduct had caused his forfeiture of the crown,
which would otherwise have been legitimately his beyond the power
of anyone on earth to take it away from him.


William was consequently at perpetual warfare with some of the
continental states; and it was only when he got into discredit with
his subjects that he seemed to rise in favour with some of the absolute
monarchs, who then, for the first time, appeared disposed to bear
with him. Louis of France listened to the terms of an arrangement;
but he never intended to keep faith with William, and was, in fact,
intriguing with Spain to defeat the very project he pretended to be
willing to carry out with the duped majesty of England. It was
evident that the British public did not look with favour upon the
individual that had been chosen to enact the part of king; and
though, like the frogs in the fable, the people had rejoiced in being
relieved from the devouring stork of absolutism embodied in the
Stuarts, the Dutch log of which William formed the type was quite
as distasteful to the nation in general.


It would be most unprofitable to unravel the tangled thread of
events that made up the complicated but most uninteresting annals
of this worrying reign, which was distinguished by the multiplicity
and the pettiness of the disputes between the prince and a portion of
his people. The loggishness of the sovereign seemed to affect the
whole nation with the loggerheads; and not only were parties
arrayed against each other, but on some occasions the Lords and
the Commons came into very serious collision. The disputes in
which William was involved with foreign governments were
exceedingly costly to his own country, but he finally, on the 7th of
<!-- Leaf 393, Page: 355 -->
September, 1701, after having been a party to several treaties that had
been either violated or " gone off," entered into a " second grand
alliance" at the Hague, with various powers. By this
arrangement all the parties were bound to provide men and money, which
their people of course had to pay; and the emperor, who had made
himself liable to furnish a contingency, was so excessively hard up,
that he was compelled to borrow the money upon his
quicksilvermines; but no silver, however quick, could keep pace with the rapidity
with which the money was called for and got rid of.


We will now return for a few minutes to James II., who was in a
very bad way at St. Germains, and was understood to have been
dying all the summer. At length, on Friday, the 2nd of September,
he was taken very bad indeed with a fainting fit, but got better,
until another and another still succeeded; and the last fit was
stronger than the first. On Tuesday, the 13th, Louis came to his
bedside to say " How d'ye do ? " but poor James was unable to
answer the polite and obliging inquiry, for he was almost without
consciousness. Louis kindly endeavoured to comfort his last
moments by promising to protect his family, and treat the nominal
Prince of Wales as actual king of England, but this recognition was
not likely to do much good either to the dead or the living, as the
only parties who were capable of giving it effect, namely, the
English people, would have nothing whatever to do with it. Poor
James, who was dosed with a great deal of medicine, and swallowed
no end of James's powders, was now beyond the aid of medical skill,
and he died on the 16th of September, 1701, at the age of sixty-seven.
An attempt was made to pitchfork this very indifferent sovereign
into the Roman Calendar as a first-rate saint; but there has never
been any disposition among the English to award him the honours
of martyrdom.


William was by no means the thing in his own health, when the
news of the death of James was brought to him. A report was
indeed spread that, like a bill at thirty days, he had only a month to
run; but this rumour was circulated by the friends of Louis XIV.,
who fancied that if William was once out of the way, the grana
monarque might be as potent in Europe as the bull of fabled lore
<!-- Leaf 394, Page: 356 -->
was at his ease in the china shop. William had been in Holland,
where he was really dangerously ill; but he contrived to get back to
England, where he dissolved Parliament in November, 1701, and
called a new one together, which met on the 31st of December, to
see the old year out and the new year in, and for the despatch of
business. The king made a long and rather an effective speech,
which had been written expressly for the occasion by Lord Somers,
and had a great effect in giving an impetus to the waning fidelity of
the people towards the sovereign of their selection. They might,
however, have exclaimed with the poet, that they " never loved a
young—or old—gazelle," without the usual unhappy result; for just
as they were getting to know William well, and love him—or at
least to pretend to do so—he was attacked in such a manner as to
make him " sure to die."


He had been a great deal shaken by the severity of the winter;
but it was hoped he would recover in the spring, which he probably
might have done, but for an accident that befell him on the road
between Kensington and Hammersmith. " A-hunting he would go,
would go," in that savage suburb, whose wildness is remarkable to
this day, and his horse coming to a block of stone, was unfortunate
enough to find it a regular stumbling-block. William was thrown
with some force, and experienced a fracture of the collar-bone, when,
having been removed to Hampton Court, the medical men began to
quarrel about the treatment of his Majesty. They of course made no
bones about setting the collar; but a dispute arose about the
necessity for bleeding the king, and in the heat of the argument, the
physicians all pulled at his pulse with such fury, that they unset the
bone, " while intending," says Burnet, " to make a dead set at one
another." The doctors continuing fractious, the fracture got worse,
and at length, on the 8th of March, 1702, the royal patient expired.
He had reigned thirteen years and a half, and was in the fifty-second
year of his age when the fatal catastrophe happened.


The character of William will not add much to the reputation of
British royalty in former days, when sovereigns were so bad that
they would never have been allowed to pass current in times like
these, in which there is a disposition to examine closely the weight
<!-- Leaf 395, Page: 357 -->
and quality of the metal. He was by no means popular when alive,
and bad characters do not, like old port, improve by keeping. The
state of parties during his reign made him the centre in which a
great deal of odium met, for he happened to form in his own person  
  
  
  
William III. ool Hunting.

the embodiment, or rather the representative, of certain principles
which were regarded with the utmost aversion by many.


The most valuable attribute of William, which has handed him
down as an object of respect and even of enthusiasm in the minds of
some, is the fact of the question of constitutional monarchy having
been settled in the affirmative by his elevation to the throne of
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P395_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 396, Page: 358 -->
England. His case is certainly valuable as a precedent, but its
greatest value consists in the probability that its existence will
spare the country hereafter from the disagreeable necessity of being
obliged to follow it. English sovereigns have learned the possibility
of their being set aside like James II., and replaced by one who,
like William III., owed his power to the will of the people. Such
revolutions as that of 1688, notwithstanding the glorious character
that belongs to it, are better as beacons for rulers than as
precedents for the people, since a change of dynasty, however
constitutionally effected, must be at all times an unpleasant, not to say a
deplorable process.


William III. is entitled to the very highest admiration for having
succeeded in holding firmly a position from which the slightest
vacillation would have inevitably shaken him. His early stipulation
for all the throne or none, and his repudiation of the right of his wife
to interfere, though domestically harsh, was politically respectable.
The constitution underwent during his reign some of the most
substantial and valuable repairs that were ever bestowed upon it, either
before or since, notwithstanding some very high-sounding nominal
advantages that the country has in ancient and modern times
experienced. It was in William's reign that the Commons took the
purse-strings of the country tightly in hand, and the censorship of
the press was, during the same period, permitted to expire. The
Judges were secured in their places during good behaviour; and
members of the Privy Council being compelled, by the Act of
Settlement, to sign the measures they proposed, we obtain from William's
reign the blessing of a responsible Cabinet. It is true that official
heads fell more frequently before than since, but the great salubrity
of the provision to which we allude is shown in the fact that it has
secured the good conduct of ministers so effectually, as to have
preserved their heads upon their shoulders.


It is a curious truth that the National Debt increased marvellously
during William's reign, and there would seem, therefore, to be some
reason for the common assertion, that this tremendous liability is a
mark of our national prosperity. It certainly proves our credit to
be good, as a load of debt in the case of an individual would make
<!-- Leaf 397, Page: 359 -->
it evident that his tradesmen had trusted him, but no one will
contend that, on that account, he must be considered more prosperous.


It was the great increase of the government expenses that had
caused the augmentation of the National Debt, and afforded another
illustration of the infallible principle, that nothing good can be had
without liberally paying for it. We might get a republic done for us
no doubt at a hundredth part—or less—of the cost of our present
excellent constitutional monarchy; but we do not think any reasonable
person would feel very anxious to try the cheap and nasty experiment.


Some historians who have preceded us, fall into what we consider
the error of eulogising William as if he had been the author of all
the good that occurred in his reign, when the fact is that a great
deal was accomplished, not alone without his agency, but actually
in spite of him. When he came, or rather when he was called to
the throne, the nation had profited by experience, and had become
equally sensible to the dangers of democratic excess and of absolute
monarchy. The tyranny of the Republic, no less than that of the
Stuarts, had pointed out the safety of a middle course between the
two sorts of despotism; and William, as a very middling person in
every respect, was well adapted for the situation that appeared to be
made for him. It was owing to no particular merit on his part that
his reign was not arbitrary, for he sometimes tried his hardest to
make it so; but the good sense of the nation, sharpened by the
troubles it had lately passed through, preserved it against further
victimisation at the hands of either kings or demagogues.


As the first really constitutional sovereign, William is, we repeat,
entitled to our respect and admiration; but we must not forget that
the people themselves made the mould to which, we will admit, he
was exceedingly well adapted, for he was pliable enough to take the
right impress, and sufficiently firm to give body and substance to the
nation's beau ideal of a limited monarchy.

was originally a Miss Hyde, being the child of James by his first
wife—the daughter of Old Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon; and
she had been married to the young man known among his familiar
friends as " Georgey Porgey, Prince of Denmark."


It is a beautiful remark of Thomson, that " the women never can
keep quiet;" and Anne soon realised this estimate of the female
character by declaring war against France with the utmost
promptitude. The Commons voted the supplies necessary for pursuing
hostilities, but behaved rather shabbily to the Duke of Marlborough,
and refused to settle five thousand a year upon himself and his
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P398_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 399, Page: 361 -->
descendants out of the post office, which, as he had carried nearly
every post he had come in contact with, he declared to be exceedingly
unhandsome treatment.


The Dutch and the Germans perceiving that the King of France
had " got no friends," felt that the time had arrived for hitting
him, and echoed the English declaration of war, though their puny
voices came upon the French monarch's ear like the penny whistle
after the full-blown ophicleide. Marlborough was appointed
generalissimo of the allied army, and he certainly proved himself worthy of
the confidence reposed in him. He made the Low Countries lower
than they had ever been before, and subsequently throwing himself
upon Bavaria, he swept the independent elector before him, leaving
that unhappy individual to make his election between flight and
compromise.


On the 12th of August, 1704, Marlborough observed the enemy
marking out a camp near Blenheim, and merely muttering to
himself, " So so, my fine fellows; that's what you're after, is it ?"
he resolved on their instant discomfiture. He determined to give
battle, and on the 13th, notwithstanding a swampy country, which
greatly tested his determination to stick at nothing, he commenced an
attack in three columns, each of which behaved so gallantly as to have
deserved a supplementary column to its memory. The contest was
exceedingly fierce on both sides; but the superior skill of Marlborough
rendered the English victorious. The general was rewarded by the
grant of an estate, upon which was built a magnificent mansion called
Blenheim, after the place near which the battle was fought; and future
Dukes of Marlborough have turned many an honest, though not a very
honourable shilling, by sharing with the housekeeper and other
servants the gratuities received from the visitors to this splendid
monument of a country's generosity.


England could not rest satisfied without interfering in the disputes
of other states, and had lent a helping hand to the Archduke Charles
of Austria, who was playing a sort of game at bob-cherry with the
Spanish crown, which hung suspended over his head in a very
tempting manner. A fleet was sent under Admiral Sir George Rooke to  
  
  
  VOL. II. 3 A
<!-- Leaf 400, Page: 362 -->
convey the archduke to Lisbon; and Rooke, who was as cunning as
an old crow, proceeded towards Barcelona, which would have been
nuts for him had he succeeded in taking it. In this attempt,
however, he failed; but putting his vessel astern, and altering her gib
towards Gibraltar, he made an attack on the fortress, which he took
with the utmost facility. For this service the conqueror was rewarded
with an empty vote of thanks, and he had no sooner got the copy of
the resolution than he put it in his pipe and smoked it—according
to some; or, as others say, he merely lighted his pipe with the
valueless document.


Domestic affairs did not progress very pleasantly, and the
English began to quarrel with the Scotch, who evinced their national
propensity to come to the scratch in a very annoying manner. The
Parliaments of the two countries came into decided collision, and
the English legislature having prohibited the importation of Scotch
heifers, " there arose," says Swindle, " a heffervescence of the
most deplorable character." The queen proposed that there should
be an immediate union of the two Parliaments; but the little
matter could not be arranged, and as the two negatives could not
be induced to make an affirmative, Anne put an end to both by
a dissolution.


In the summer of 1705, Marlborough, who had been waiting on the
banks of the Blue Moselle, forced the French lines, and very hard
lines they proved both to the vanquished and the victors.


We must here be permitted to introduce the beautiful episode
of Sir Isaac Newton, and turn from the turmoils of war to the
peaceful pursuits of science. We are sure we shall not be accused
of irrelevancy if we step aside from the rushing stream of
history which, like a cataract, is hurrying us rapidly along, and enjoy
a few moments of calm reflection on the life and merits of the
great philosopher.


Isaac Newton was born in 1642, and came as unusually little into
the world as he went greatly, and indeed gigantically, out of it. His
mother declared he might have been put into a quart pot at his birth,
and therefore, had he been always judged by the rule of "measures,
<!-- Leaf 401, Page: 363 -->
not men," he would never have attained the elevation he has arrived
at. In early boyhood he displayed a great mechanical turn, and
buying a box of carpenter's tools, he got perhaps the first insight
into plane geometry, and deduced from a few wise saws, a variety of
modern instances. He was very fond of measuring time, but not by  
  
  
  Discovery of the Laws of Gravitation by Isaac Newton

its loss alone, for he constructed a wooden clock, and ascertained the
position of the sun by driving nails into the wall—hitting, no doubt,
the right one on the head very readily.


Having a shrewd suspicion that there was something in the wind,
he would occupy himself in leaping with it and against it, to
ascertain its power. These pranks did not elevate him much in his class,
of which he was generally at the bottom; for the routine of his school
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P401_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 402, Page: 364 -->
education did not include trials of strength with old Boreas, and the
other exciting pursuits in which Master Isaac Newton indulged
himself. In course of time he was removed to Cambridge, where the
works of Descartes fell into his hands, and where those ponderous
volumes, from their soporific effect upon youth, often fall out of the
hands they have fallen into. Young Newton grasped them with
energy, and he soon profited amazingly by their contents, which
set his own mind at work to add to the stock of discovery already
in existence.


During the great plague of 1665, he was compelled to leave
Cambridge for a rural retirement, though the rustication was not of
the ordinary kind: and while sitting in an orchard, " his custom
sometimes of an afternoon," an apple fell upon his head with
considerable violence. Beginning to reason from this "argumentum ad
hominem," he asked himself why every other object did not at once
fall to the earth; and he even speculated on the possibility of the
moon alighting heavily, and leaving him in a literally moon-struck
condition. It was some time before he discovered the laws of
gravitation by which the apple had been carried to his head; and it is
not true, as is commonly believed, that he was struck all of a heap
with the great truths that he has given to posterity. They were
published in 1687, at the expense of the Royal Society, under the
title of the " Principia; " and it is a curious fact, that the critics of
the day were not altogether pleased with it. Some few pronounced
it " a work that ought to be on every gentleman's sideboard," and
our old friend, the evening paper, patronised it as a production that
might " repay perusal;" * but some very learned, very cold, very
dull, and very stupid "gentlemen of the press" " regretted that Mr.
Newton should have wasted so much time upon a work of such a
description." They were angry with him for what they considered
his levity in popularising serious matters, and advised him to keep
his hands off the moon, which was far too lofty a subject for him
to meddle with.


* A curious puzzle has been suggested by a celebrated arithmetician, who has
expressed a desire to know how many of the works that the reviewers say will " repay
perusal," are likely to " repay the printer."
<!-- Leaf 403, Page: 365 -->

It has been noticed as a very unaccountable circumstance, that
Newton never made any important addition to scientific discovery
after he had completed his forty-fifth year; though he lived to be
eighty-four, and had therefore got beyond the period at which the
poet's apostrophe, "O Vir he-eighty" might have been addressed
to him. He was exceedingly fond of tobacco, and it is believed
that he felt more at home in his astronomical reflections when he
could envelope himself in a cloud of his own blowing. The old
saying, that " There is no smoke without fire," received an apt
confirmation from the fact that Newton was scarcely ever without
a pipe in his mouth during the most brilliant and blazing period
of his genius.


We now return to Anne, who, anno 1705, went to Cambridge,
where she knighted Mr. Newton, who was the Mathematical
Professor at Trinity College. We feel we ought not to pass over in
silence a piece of wonderful self-denial on the part of a lawyer,
which gives to this reign a peculiarity that ought to make it stand
apart from all that have preceded or followed it. There had been
formerly an old custom of making a present to the Lord Chancellor
on New Year's Day, at the cost of the practitioners, who usually
contributed about fifteen hundred pounds, which previous keepers
of the royal conscience had most unconscientiously pocketed. To
the great honour of Lord Chancellor Cowper be it spoken, he
declined the proffered bonus, which appeared to him to resemble
somewhat too closely a bribe, and thus set an early example of
disinterestedness, by which the tone of judicial morality was improved,
and has at last reached the pertection we have at the present day the
satisfaction of witnessing.


The subject of the Union between England and Scotland, which
had from time to time been discussed, was at length taken into
serious consideration at a place called the Cockpit, from which the
reader must not infer that it was considered as a sporting event, and
that the betting men were chiefly interested in promoting it. After
a great deal of disagreement, the preliminaries were ultimately
settled, and on the 6th of March, 1707, the royal assent was given to
the Act of Union. There were no less than twenty-five articles, by
<!-- Leaf 404, Page: 366 -->
the majority of which the Scotch had been cunning enough to make
the best bargain for themselves; and they had taken care that if the
British Lion got the Lion's share, they would, at least, secure the
Fox's perquisites. The Union took effect from the ist of May, and
the queen went in state to St. Paul's, to celebrate the event with
due solemnity.


The 22 nd of October in the same year derives a mournful interest
from the loss of poor Shovel, whose ship got scuttled on the rocks of  
  
  
  Joy for the Union.

Scilly, and though Shovel himself went at it " poker and tongs "
to save the vessel, his own and two others were involved in the
same calamity.


On the 28th of October, 1708, the queen lost her husband, Prince
George of Denmark, who died of asthma, at Kensington. His
malady, of course, prevented him from having a voice in public
affairs; but if he had had one, he would certainly have been afraid
of using it. He combined the mildness of the moonbeam with the
stupidity of the jackass, and not only had he been born with a silver
spoon in his mouth, but he had become one entire spoon—fiddle-head
and all—in his excessive pliability. He was, however, one of those
spoons that made very little stir, and his removal from the busy
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P404_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 405, Page: 367 -->
scene of life left a gap that was scarcely perceptible. Within little
better than three months, both Houses of Parliament addressed the
queen, imploring her to marry again, which shows that they did not
estimate very highly her grief at the loss of her first husband.
Her Majesty's reply contained no specific answer to the petition,
but intimated her belief that a decided response was not expected
by the applicants.


On the 5th of November in the same year a political parson,
named Dr. Sacheverel, began to raise the since famous cry of " Church
in danger," which, like that of "Wolf," has been since so frequently
and foolishly set up, that it stands a chance of being neglected when
it really may require attention. The object of all the rant in which
this noisy churchman indulged, was to obtain popularity, flavoured
with a spice of martyrdom, and his opponents being silly enough to
fall into the trap, they kept up the ball for him with a vivacity that
must have equalled his most sanguine desire. Like a shuttlecock,
that must drop to the ground if its elevation is not secured by frequent
blows, Sacheverel would have tumbled irredeemably to the earth, if
he had not been kept aloft by the knocks he experienced.


He was ultimately exalted into the position of a delinquent
standing to take his trial at the bar of the House of Lords; and when he
was found guilty of having preached a sermon, warning the public of
danger to the Church, he had reached the highest point of glory in
the estimation of the large mass of people who are under the
influence of bigotry and prejudice. He was condemned to forbear from
preaching for three years; but his sentence not excluding him from
accepting a good living, one was placed at his disposal immediately
afterwards. The reverend sufferer for conscience' sake eventually
got something still better, in the form of the living of St. Andrew's,
Holborn, where, finding it no longer worth his while to quarrel with
the Government, he sought a vent for his turbulent disposition in
repeated rows with his parishioners. His first sermon after his new
appointment sold 40,000 copies, and a little calculation will give
some idea of what the reverend gentleman's martyrdom brought him
in from first to last in the shape of livings, copyrights, and other
contingencies that arise out of a well-managed popularity.
<!-- Leaf 406, Page: 368 -->

In the latter end of 1711, some very disreputable disclosures, in
which the Duke of Marlborough and Mr. Walpole were chiefly
involved, were brought before the House of Commons. Marlborough,
not satisfied with his pay, pensions, and other emoluments, had been
taking a percentage on every transaction in which he had been
confidentially concerned; while Walpole, in his capacity of Secretary
at War, had been playing the same game as the illustrious soldier.
Marlborough and his wife were in the enjoyment of upwards of sixty
thousand a year, so that there was no excuse for them on the score of
poverty; and even if they had been in want of cash, they might have
done what, as we have already hinted, their successors have done
since, namely, shown Blenheim to the public, and shared with their
own domestics the daily proceeds. The duke and duchess were
deprived of their offices, while Mr. Walpole was expelled from the
House of Commons, amid a chorus of " Serve him right" from nearly
the whole of his fellow-countrymen.


Marlborough was further accused by Lord Paulet of having
knocked his own officers on the head, in order to be enabled to sell
their commissions; but this would seem to have been a most
superfluous piece of atrocity, for he might have easily got their
heads knocked off in a more regular and reputable manner, by
exposing them to the blows of the enemy. The Duke challenged
Lord Paulet for having made this assertion; but after an interchange
of hostile messages, the seconds contrived so to complicate the
business as to lose sight of the real matter of dispute, and the duel was
prevented. The reputation of Marlborough was so damaged by what
had taken place, that he obtained permission of the queen to go
abroad, and he crossed over to Ostend, in the vague hope that a sea
voyage might have the same effect it is said to produce on a bottle ot
Madeira, and cause an improvement of his quality.


The disgrace of the British general had been fortunately delayed
till the period when his services were no longer required, for the
treaty of Utrecht, which was signed on the 30th of March, 1713,
secured the peace of Europe. By this celebrated arrangement the
Protestant succession in England was formally recognised; the
crowns of France and Spain were split into two, giving those
<!-- Leaf 407, Page: 369 -->
countries one apiece; the harbour of Dunkirk was demolished, and
other little matters of difference settled to the satisfaction of all
parties, except the Emperor of Germany, who stood aside in a corner
by himself, objecting to everything.


Just before the close of the year, while political matters of
importance were on foot, the gout laid Queen Anne by the heels, at

Windsor, and the funds suffered in sympathy with the toe of royalty.
There was a rapid run upon the bank; but the gout abating so far
as to enable her Majesty to bear the weight of a shoe, the pressure
was relieved immediately, and the country stood much as before,
which may also be said of the sovereign.


On the 2 nd of March, 1714, the queen came down in a sedan to
open Parliament. Her use of the chair arose from her being very  
  
  
  VOL. 11. 3 B
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P407_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 408, Page: 370 -->
chary of her foot, which retained some of the effects of the havoc
that gout had performed upon it. In the course of her speech she
took the opportunity of assuring the House that the Protestant
succession was not in danger, and the House of Commons subsequently
assured itself of the same fact—as far as words could go—in a
resolution that was carried by a large majority. These repeated
assurances proved more than anything else that the Protestant
succession was not quite so safe as the queen and the Parliament
could have desired, and a number of precautionary measures directed
against the Pretender and the Jacobites furnished still stronger
proof that the Government really entertained the fears it seemed
so very anxious to repudiate.


On the 29th of July, 1714, the queen, who was almost tired out by
the disputes of her Ministers, fell into a lethargy, and the Council,
who had been quarrelling in the Cockpit, adjourned to Kensington.
At this critical juncture, an individual of the name of Mr. Craggs
suddenly started on to the canvas of history as the writer of a letter
to the Elector of Brunswick, apprising him of the perilous condition
of the queen, and telling him that his succession would be quietly
provided for. On the 1st of August, poor Anne expired of dropsy,
in the fiftieth year of her age, the thirteenth of her reign, the third of
her gout, and the first of her lethargy.


In person, Anne was of the middle size, as far as height was
concerned; but if we look at her as a piece of measurement goods, and
take her by her bulk, we shall have to put upon her a very different
estimate. It cannot be said that she was one of Nature's favourites,
though Nature had certainly made much of her, and perhaps more
than the queen herself would have desired. Her hair was dark
brown, and her complexion a sort of clear mahogany, while her nose
standing prominently out from a very round face, gave her something
the appearance of a perpendicular sun-dial. Her voice was as clear
as a bell, and her tongue as active as the clapper. Her capacity
was good, but her acquirements miserably few, and her mind
therefore presented a resemblance to a fine site for building, which had
remained uncovered for want of the necessary capital. She was
very fond of hunting, but she had a very odd way of showing her
<!-- Leaf 409, Page: 371 -->
fondness, for she used to follow the hounds in a pony chaise, which of
course became a vehicle for a good deal of merriment. All historians
concur in saying that she lived very fast, but whether it was in
eating or in drinking that her weakness, or rather her strength, was
shown, the various authorities are not yet agreed upon. She was a
mother to her people, a master to her husband, a pattern to her own
sex, and a terror to ours. She was obstinately attached to her own
way, and it was only the fortunate feebleness of her intellect that
prevented her from developing herself into that gigantic nuisance, a
strong-minded woman. Though her own mental powers were not
sufficient to throw lustre on her reign, it was rendered glorious by
numerous men of learning and genius who were the contemporaries
of her majesty. We have already enjoyed a paragraph or two with
Newton, and we must not forget Locke, who furnished so many keys
to the understanding and the difficult arts of government.


Considering the fuss that has lately been made about the merit of
having originated penny and twopenny publications, we ought not to
forget that the modern claimants to the honour of the idea did but
steal it from Steele, whose "Tatler," started in 1709, was followed
by the " Spectator" and the " Guardian." To the more recent
projectors of cheap periodicals we are quite ready to allow the originality
of their assertion, that their speculations are not intended for their
own profit, but to fulfil exclusively the great purpose of benefiting the
community. In compliance with these large-hearted and benevolent
intentions, we may, we suppose, look with confidence to the day
when the produce will be paid over for the benefit of the people,
whom the existing race of cheap periodical proprietors love so very
much better than they do themselves, if we are to believe their
protestations and their prospectuses.


We may at all events say for the reign of Anne, that it was much
freer than the reign of Victoria from these wondrous professions of
disinterestedness, which we have been waiting in vain, for the last
ten years, to see carried into practice.

granddaughter to James I., through whom he had pretensions to a good
title, though, oddly enough, the Stuart family being repudiated, the
only legitimate portion of his claim was that which the country
refused to recognise. It seemed, however, that England, after its
numerous wars of succession, which had formed a long succession
of wars, was resolved upon putting up with anything for peace
and quietness—a contented disposition of which we have long
experienced the blessings, inasmuch as it has given us a family of
sovereigns under whose constitutional sway the country has enjoyed
an unexampled degree of prosperity and happiness.


George I. was a sober, decent, steady-going person of fifty-four
when he arrived to undertake the superintendence of England, by
the day, week, month, or year; and, in fact, to do monarch's work in
general. He was proclaimed king in London, on the i st of August,
1714, but was in no particular hurry to enter upon his new dignity,
for he only arrived, via Greenwich, on September the 18th, and his
coronation took place on the 20th of October following. He was of
course old enough to know pretty well what he was about; and
though he had attained that respectable maturity which, among the
feathered tribe, is believed to form a protection against capture by
chaff, he seems to have acted on the impression that younger birds
might certainly be caught by the same unsatisfactory material. His
first plan, therefore, upon his arrival, was to go about uttering what
he called his " maxim," which he said was " never to abandon his
friends, to do justice to all the world, and to fear no man." This
egotistical puff for his own qualities may have been politic, but it was
by no means dignified, and reminds us more of the old self-laudatory
naval song commencing " We tars have a maxim d'ye see," than of
any language or sentiment becoming to the mouth and mind of a
monarch. If the English people had put upon the clap-trap
sentiment of the Hanoverian its true interpretation, they would have
seen that it pledged him more to his old subjects than engaged him
to his new ones; and the result of his reign quite justified the view
we are disposed to take of the meaning of his "maxim."


Immediately on the death of Anne, the Privy Council had met
and deputed the Earl of Dorset to go over and apprise George of his
<!-- Leaf 412, Page: 374 -->
accession to the crown, when the earl mixed up the announcement
with so many fulsome compliments, that flattery took the name of
Dorset butter—a figure that has remained in force from those days
to the present.


One of the best, and perhaps the boldest acts of the Council, was
the appointment of Mr. Addison—the celebrated contributor to what
was termed par excellence the P. P. or popular periodical of the day—
to a post in the Government. The late Ministry had been
ignominiously displaced, and Bolingbroke used to dangle about at the
door of the Council-room with a bag of papers in his hand,
expecting, or at least hoping to be called in, while menials were
instructed to deride, or, as the modern phrase has it, to " chaff" him
in the passages. Bolingbroke was mean enough to brook even this
for the chance of place; but he would occasionally turn round and
shake his fist, including his bag, in a menacing manner at the crew
who passed upon him these insults. Occasionally they would slap
him on the back, exclaiming, " Well, Bolly, my boy, you are indeed
a regular out-and-outer." Nor can it be doubted, that, had the air
been popular at the period, the Ethiopian melody of " Who's dat
knocking at de Door ? " would have been frequently sung or whistled
in the face of Bolingbroke by the scamps in the waiting-room.


The king had only just arrived, and had merely gone into his
bedroom to put on a clean collar—that of the Order of the Garter, if we
may hazard a shrewd guess—when a party of Whigs rushed in, and
began to ear-whig him with the utmost industry. In fact, the
touting that took place for the vacant offices can only be imagined
by an individual who has once landed at Boulogne, and found
himself torn to pieces by the hirsute representatives of some fifty
hotels, each anxious to accommodate the new arrival. The whole of
the Whig party pounced upon George, and thrust their pretensions
before him with the perseverance of the class of Frenchmen,
commonly called commissioners, to whom we have alluded. As these
persons snatch at a traveller's cloak, walking-stick, or carpet-bag,
the Whig touters almost snatched at gold sticks, official portfolios,
or anything else they could lay their hands upon. " Allow me to
take charge of your conscience, sir," roared Lord Cowper; "tyou'll
<!-- Leaf 413, Page: 375 -->
find it very heavy to carry, sir; pray give it to me, sir; I'll take it
down for you, sir; " and thus the Chancellorship was in a measure
seized by this determined place-hunter. "You'll lose that privy seal,
sir, if you don't take care," bellowed the Earl of Wharton; " you had
much better entrust it to me; there are some very bad characters  
  
  
  
George 1. putting on a clean Collar.  
  
  
  about just now,"—and thus, by a mixture of warning and worry, the

privy seal was secured for himself by the rapacious nobleman


Bolingbroke, after hanging about the official passages for a short
time longer, now listening at the door, now peeping through the
keyhole, and alternately bullied or bantered by his more fortunate
rivals as they passed to and fro, resolved on flying to the Continent.
Several significant exclamations of "You'd better be off;" "Come,
come, this won't do;" and "We can't have a parcel of idle fellows
lurking about the Treasury," convinced him that he had nothing to
hope, and everything to fear from the new parliament. He
accordingly took from the corner of his sitting-room an old official wand,
and sobbing out, " Farewell, my once cherished stick ! " he cut it for
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P413_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 414, Page: 376 -->
ever. The monopoly of all the snug places by the Whigs rendered
them extremely overbearing, and as " Britons never, never, never
will be slaves" to the same party for any considerable length of
time, they became impatient of Whig arrogance, and ready for an
alterative in the shape of some regular old Tory tyranny. The king
became unpopular, and his birth-day passed over without the smallest
notice, as if to hint to him that he was not to be born at all, unless he
changed his system.


George, instead of conciliating, attempted to crush the disaffected,
and like a bad equestrian mounted on a restive horse, he began
pulling at the rein, and tightening the curb, instead of mildly but
firmly exclaiming, " Wo, wo, boys ! steady, boys; steady!" to his
now somewhat frisky people. The Habeas Corpus Act—the great
British Free List—was suspended, and the Pretender was used as a
pretence to alarm the people, and reconcile them to the most
arbitrary measures. The Riot Act was in this year, 1715, read a
third time and passed, but it has this peculiarity, which distinguishes
it from every other legislative act, that it requires to be read again
on every occasion of its being brought into requisition.


These measures only added fuel to the fire that was now setting
the country in a blaze; and even the University of Oxford was
threatened with assault by Major-General Pepper, who was the
first to make the now venerable joke about mustard, which, with all
our courage, we confess we dare not chronicle.*


In the north, the insurrection took a very bold form, and Mr.
Forster, a gentleman of great ability—a barrister, we believe—joined
with the Earl of Derwentwater, who was ready with all his retainers,
the only kind of retainers, by the way, with which his learned
colleague was at all familiar. Being joined by some gentlemen in
blue bonnets, who had come from over the border, they proclaimed
the Pretender, and would have seized upon Newcastle, with the
intention of sparing the coals and sacking only the city; but the

brought out under the title of " The Family Joe Miller," is the best for the student's

gate had been shut, and the whole party was not strong enough to
force it open. They retired therefore to Hexham, and a literary
gentleman among them bewailed their failure, as he sat in the
coffeeroom of the Inn at Hexham, in doleful hexameters. They next
retired by way of Lancaster to Preston, whose Pans they hoped would
prove preserving pans to themselves; but General Wills being sent
to attack them, proved the fact, that where there are the Wills there
are always the ways of accomplishing an object.


Mr. Forster, hearing that there was no hope, despatched a
trumpeter—a gentlemanly young man, who was quite equal to a solo
of the kind—to negotiate a treaty. He could get no other answer
than an intimation that the rebels might expect to be slaughtered;
and, being very much cut up by the news, they wisely resolved to
surrender. The noblemen and officers of the party were sent to
London, where they were led through the streets bound together and
pinioned, which caused one of them to wish that his pinions were
those of a bird, so that he might be enabled to fly away from his
captivity. Though the Pretender must have known, or might have
known, that his pretensions were about as hopeless as they could
possibly be, he resolved on landing in Scotland, and he positively
arrived with nothing more than a special train of six gentlemen. He
came in disguise, and passed through Aberdeen without being known,
till he came to Feterosse, where he was met by the Earl of Mar and
thirty nobles of the first quality, though all their quality could not
of course make up for their lamentable deficiency in quantity.


When the Pretender saw his friend's beggarly show of adherents,
he addressed Mar with great levity, telling him he had been "a
sad Mar to his hopes," and indulged in other poor frivolities. " As
I've come, however," he added, " I may as well be proclaimed;"
and the ceremony was gone through with mock gravity. He next
proceeded to Scone, " for," said he, " we must have a coronation,
you know; " and he behaved altogether in such a manner as to lead
us to believe that he relished the ludicrous points of his own very
ridiculous position. Having gone so far in the mockery, he crowned
the absurdity instead of being crowned himself, by making a speech
to his grand council, intimating that he had no arms to fight with,  
  
  
  VOL. II. 3 c
<!-- Leaf 416, Page: 378 -->
no ammunition to load the arms with if he possessed any, and no
money to purchase the ammunition if he felt disposed to try its effects
upon his enemies. Under these circumstances, he intimated that his
presence among them should be regarded as a flying visit, just to say
\"How d'ye do," and " Good bye; " after which, with the latter
salutation on his lips, he popped into a boat, and was " off again"
for the Continent.


Instead of allowing this miserable rebellion to die a natural death
—we cannot say that it ended in smoke, for the rebels had no money
to purchase gunpowder—the government of the day had the rashness
to keep the thing alive by prosecuting those who had been concerned
in it. Half-a-dozen nobles were seized and put upon their trial,
when the poor creatures, whimpering out an acknowledgment of their
guilt, were sentenced to death, and two were taken to the scaffold.
A third, the Lord Nithesdale, had also been condemned; but his
mother having come to see him in prison, they got up between them
a dramatic incident, by effecting an exchange of dress; and while
the lady remained in gaol like a man, the gentleman walked away in
female attire.


The prosecutions were not limited to the chiefs of this rebellious
movement—if that can be called a movement which stuck fast in its
very first steps—but some of the humblest adherents, or suspected
adherents, of the Pretender's cause were included in the proceedings
taken by the Government. Several were hanged, and some hundreds
experienced what was facetiously termed the "royal mercy," by
undergoing transportation for life to North America. This
unnecessary and injudicious rigour had the effect of making the Government
so unpopular, that, although according to the Triennial Act the
Parliament ought to have been dissolved, the ministers were afraid
of appealing to the country, and formed the audacious determination
to introduce a Septennial Act, which, by the force of perseverance
and impudence combined, was positively carried. Though George
resided personally in England, his heart had never quitted Hanover,
and he was continually keeping his eye upon the aggrandisement of
that paltry electorate. For this purpose, he made free use of English
money; and having intelligence at all times of the small Duchies
<!-- Leaf 417, Page: 379 -->
that the poverty of their owners occasionally threw into the market,
he picked up those of Bremen and Verden at a very low figure.


Among- the inconveniences occasioned to this country by allowing
the sceptre to get into foreign hands, was the involving of England
in foreign quarrels about foreign interests. Spain, being in an
unpleasant predicament, called upon George I. to join a league in her
favour, and threatened to repudiate his claims to his dismal little
duchies of Bremen and Verden, if he did not take the step that was
required of him. As he could not well commit himself thus far, a
war was commenced against England, and a Spanish expedition
under the Duke of Ormond was fitted out to make a descent upon
Scotland. With that happy adroitness in ruling the waves for which
Britannia has long been celebrated, she caused them to rise as one
billow against the hostile fleet, which was rapidly dispersed by the
ocean's uppishness. Though the buoyancy of Britain, assisted by
the boisterous energy of the sea, defeated the attempts of foreign
powers, the internal condition of the country was far from
satisfactory. King George neither comprehended the character nor the
language of his new subjects, and a good understanding between the
prince and the people was therefore impossible. His Majesty spent
as much time and as much money as he could upon the Continent,
leaving his ministers to propose what measures they pleased, while
he transmitted by post his consent to them, without knowing, or
caring to inquire their object.


Perhaps, however, the heaviest blow that England's prosperity
ever received was the result of one of the most marvellous instances
on record of a co-operation between knavery and folly. To add to
the extraordinary character of the infatuation we are about to record,
the scheme that led to it was not original, and the victims had
consequently received a warning by which they failed to profit. A
Scotchman of the name of Law had swindled the whole of France by
starting a company to pick up fortunes in the Mississippi, which proved
one of the most gigantic misses ever known; but as one batch of fools
will make many, it was calculated, shrewdly enough, that the
Mississippi hoax, instead of putting people on their guard against fraud,
would have just the effect of preparing them to be taken in by it.

A scrivener named Blunt—a fellow of uncommon sharpness,
whose name is emblematical of a great partiality for cash—suggested
a concern called the South Sea Company, which was to purchase
all the debts due from the Government to all trading corporations,
and thus become the sole creditor of the state. The national debt
was in fact to be bought up, and as there is a pretty clear
understanding that the national debt never will, or never can be paid, the
advantages of the project must upon the slightest reflection have
appeared at best apocryphal. The scrip in this grand concern came
out heavy, for the securities were flatter than the public, when a
bright idea flashed across the mind of Blunt for raising the wind and
puffing up the shares in the South Sea Scheme to the utmost_ height
that could be desired. He spread a report through paid paragraphs
in the newspapers, that Gibraltar and Minorca were about to be
exchanged for Peru, and the whole world went mad at the peru-sal.
The story of this monstrous piece of universal insanity would afford a
fine subject for an article from the pen of Dr. Forbes Winslow; * and
indeed had he lived in the eighteenth century, the whole population
would have been worthy to become the patients of that able and
experienced master of the science of mental pathology.


The mental aberration of the public proved itself in the most
preposterous demand for shares from persons willing to stake not only
every penny they had, but many pounds which they had not. The
proverb that " one fool makes many," found a parallel in the fact
that one knave makes many; for the South Sea schemer called into
existence a number of imitators, all anxious to profit by the credulity
which he had excited. One adventurer made his fortune one fine
morning by issuing a prospectus intimating that he would secure to
every one who paid two guineas on the instant, an annuity of one
hundred pounds. The preliminary deposits poured in so plentifully
that he obtained two thousand subscribers in a few hours, though
the details of the plan were only to be forthcoming at some future
day. We regret exceedingly our inability to form an opinion on the
merits of this project, for its originator, having been called away

suddenly on the very night after the first day's subscriptions had
been paid in, pursued his way to the Continent by the light of the
moon, and has never yet returned. Charity bids us presume that he
died in the effort to mature the gigantic idea he had conceived for
enriching those who had honoured him with their cash and their
confidence. A few little episodes of this description tended to shake the
faith of the public in the great parent hoax, and the monster bubble,
formed, as it were, by the whole of the South Sea concentrated into
one tremendous drop, gave symptoms of dropping to the ground.


Those who witnessed the Railway Mania of 1845 can form a
conception—though a very inadequate one—of the madness that
prevailed in the early part of the eighteenth century, under the cunning
influence of Blunt, who, strange to say, was a living illustration of
a marvellous misnomer, for this Blunt was the essence of sharpness,
at a time when obtuseness was the characteristic of all the rest of
the community. The amiable weakness which, in 1845, induced the
whole population to concur in planning railways for every hole and
corner of the world, the philanthropy which would have whirled the
Cherokees through the air at sixty miles an hour and twenty per
cent, profit, or brought Kamschatka, Chelsea, the Catskill mountains,
Knightsbridge, and Niagara, all into a group by the aid of trunk-lines
or branches connecting the whole of them together, the mixture of
benevolence and self-interest which suggested these noble
achievements, cannot bear a comparison with the universality of the
movement that the South Sea Bubble called forth. Its bursting, however,
nearly swamped the entire nation, for the bubble had been so
extensive that scarcely anyone escaped its influence, or could keep his
head above water, when the awful inundation occurred.


Royalty itself had not been exempt from the prevailing madness,
and the Prince of Wales had been appointed Governor of the Welsh
Copper Company, which was to have supplied saucepans to the
whole civilised world, and kept the pot boiling for the inhabitants
of every corner of the globe. The capital proposed to be raised for
all the various bubbles in agitation, amounted to three hundred
millions, though few of the concerns had even the capital of the
soi-disant millionaire in the farce, who having made promises of
<!-- Leaf 420, Page: 382 -->
boundless liberality, and undertaken to make the fortune of the
waiting-maid of his inamorata, finished with a tender of a
fourpenny piece as an earnest of his future bounty.


It would form a curious chapter in this or any other history, to
trace the fluctuations in South Sea Stock; but we cannot afford to
convert our pages into a Share List of the eighteenth century. Upon
the first fall in the Stock, attempts were made to preserve it from a
further decline, first by shutting up the transfer books, and secondly
by preposterous promises of impossible dividends. The Directors
kindly guaranteed fifty per cent, for twelve years, from and after the
ensuing Christmas; and it is probable that the old saying, that
"Such a thing is coming, and so is Christmas," first arose out of the
South Sea bubble, for the Stock fell from 800 to 150, between the
26th of August, when the prospect was held out, and the 30th of
September, when people had got a shrewd suspicion that it would
never be realised.


In proportion to the extreme credulity the nation had shown, was
the savage disappointment it now exhibited. The Directors of the
South Sea Company, who had been encouraged in their audacious
swindling by the blind rapacity of their dupes—who in their haste
to devour everything they could lay hold of, swallowed every knavish
story they were told—the Directors, who after all had merely
speculated on the avarice and stupidity of the rest of the world, were assailed
with the utmost vindictiveness. Their conduct was brought before
Parliament; some of them were taken into custody, and all were
called upon to explain the grounds on which these calculations of
profit were made, though the stockholders were not required to state
what reasons they had for believing with their eyes shut, all the
evidently fallacious promises that had been held out to them. A
confiscation of the property of most of the Directors took place, and an
inquiry before Parliament proved that several members of the
Legislature, and even ministers, had received considerable slices of South
Sea Stock for their assistance in promulgating this monster swindle.


The ruin that had been brought upon all classes of society,
was aggravated by a necessity for further taxation to carry on the
<!-- Leaf 421, Page: 383 -->
increased expense of Home Government, and of the costly foreign
relations which the country had entered into. It has unfortunately
happened that the foreign relations of England have been generally
very poor relations, and they have consequently taken a great deal
out of her pockets by their necessities, while they have added little to
her respectability by their position and character. Like poor relations
in general, they were a dreadful drag, and it was necessary to
contribute to their support by putting fresh burdens on the British people.


Among these was a tax on malt, which being extended to
Scotland, caused a general fermentation; for the Scotch were always
remarkable for their love of whisky, which they easily promoted
into a love of liberty, when it suited at once their pocket and their
purpose to assume the attitude of patriots. The tax—not the whisky
—was, however, crammed down their throats in spite of the cry they
had succeeded in getting up for untaxed toddy, which they, of course,
pronounced to be the safeguard of their Constitution, as everything
else becomes in its turn, when it seems to be placed in jeopardy.
The rioters, however, could get no persons of rank or influence to join
in the great whisky movement, which the masses had taken into their
heads, and order was restored after a few lives had been sacrificed.


On the 2nd of November, 1726, Sophia Dorothea, nominally, but
never practically, Queen of England, died in the prison at Hanover,
to which her husband had committed her. This lady had formed an
attachment for a Count Koningsmark, whom the king her husband,
then Elector of Hanover, unceremoniously butchered in an ante-room.
As the historians who have preceded us call his Majesty a
strongminded man, we presume that there is something intellectually
vigorous in the commission of a murder, though we confess we are at
a loss to discover the extraordinary fact which other writers appear
to have recognised.


Not very long after the death of his wife, George repaired—or
rather he went very much out of repair, for his health was greatly
damaged to Hanover. He was taken very ill on the road, and was
seized with apoplexy to the unhappy perplexity of his attendants,
whom he nevertheless desired to "push along and keep moving."
<!-- Leaf 422, Page: 384 -->
They accordingly did so, and the royal carriage was hastened, but
his Majesty was only being driven to extremities, for on the nth
of June, 1727, he expired at Osnaburgh, in the sixty-eighth year
of his age, and the thirteenth of his reign.


The particulars of his death have been very circumstantially given,
and as they are rather characteristic of George I., we will give them
with our accustomed brevity. He had been in perfect health on the
previous evening, and ate a hearty supper of sheeps' hearts,
including a tremendous melon, to which the melancholy result has been
attributed. Resuming his journey towards Hanover at 3 A.M. he
was seized with griping pains, but believing that one mischief would
correct another, he fancied the supper that had disagreed with him
would be counteracted in its consequences by a dinner, which he
began lustily calling for. When it was placed before him he could
eat nothing—an incapacity so unusual with George, or as some call
him, Gorge the First, that his attendants were seized with alarm and
astonishment. Having again entered his carriage, he exclaimed in
quaint French, " C est fait de mot," which we need scarcely intimate
means either "I'm done for," or "It's all up with me." In the course
of the same night his existence coming to an end proved the too fatal
accuracy of his own conclusion.


George I. had nothing in his character to justify us in keeping
George II. waiting to be shown up to the throne, where in the ensuing
chapter we shall have the pleasure of seeing him. The first George
was a person of somewhat feeble intellects, exceedingly shy in public,
but he could "come out" at a private tea-party at home very
effectively. His tastes were none of the most refined, and he voted all
letters exceedingly dry but O. D. V.—such was the wretched pun the
king made on eau de vie—which he was very partial to. It might be
regarded as a redeeming point in the character of his Majesty that
he was very fond of Punch, which he regularly " took in," but this
feather in his cap must be plucked out, for we find the Punch he
patronised was the liquor, and not the periodical. Avarice was
another of the most prominent features of his character, and he actually
risked the throne itself on several occasions, because he would not
spare a few pounds for the purchase of that floating loyalty that, in
<!-- Leaf 423 -->

<!-- Leaf 425, Page: 385 -->
consequence of the venality and poverty of the ancient aristocracy,
was always to be had at a certain price in the market. He had also
the shabby trick of never carrying any money in his own pocket, so
that he was always obliged to dip into the pockets of his companions
to pay the expenses incurred, either at home or abroad, and many of.
his Court used to get as far away as possible from the side of the king
when there was anything to pa}', for he was sure to ask them for-a
loan on such occasions.


It seems from pretty good authority* that he fancied himself to be
an usurper; but he flattered himself a great deal too much in
believing that the English nation would have quietly allowed an act of
usurpation from so unimportant a personage as he would have been,
but for the position into which he was called by the voice of the
people. He preferred Hanover to England; " but," says Smith,
\"there is no accounting for tastes," and we will therefore make no
effort to unravel the mystery of this absurd preference.


The Court of George I. was remarkable for its laxity, though
there was more external propriety than used to prevail in the days
of Charles II. The latter monarch openly offended against the rules
of decency; but George I. was just as bad in a quiet way, and
imported into the aristocracy of England two or three vulgar,
lowborn, German female favourites, whose successors now boast of their
illustrious ancestors.


It is a somewhat interesting fact that charity schools were first
established in the year 1698, when the predecessor of George I.
was on the throne; and the antiquarian will perhaps tell us whether
the muffin-cap is of greater antiquity than the muffin. We believe
such to be the case, for the muffin is of comparatively modern date,
and is the contemporary of its rival or companion, the crumpet.
How the muffin-cap came to put the muffin into anybody's head, is a
question too difficult for any but the archæologist.

to blame we are not in a condition to determine, but the father who
shuts his doors against a son, and drives him from home, is, primei
facie, a brute, and George I.'s conduct to his wife affords collateral
evidence of his being devoid of feeling towards those who were
nearly allied to him. It may be generally taken for granted that
sons are only indifferent towards parents who are bad, and if young
George failed in respect or affection towards old George, it was
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P426_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 427, Page: 387 -->
because old George had done nothing to inspire in young George
the sentiments which should have been entertained by a son for
his father.


Sir Robert Walpole, the minister, had endeavoured to bring the
precious couple together on friendly terms, but they would often
quarrel in his presence, and appeal to Sir Robert, until the frequency
with which they invoked the support of their referee, by loud
exclamations of " So help me Bob ! " turned the phrase into a proverb, which
is to this day prevalent among the lower and more energetic classes
of the community. When George II. came to the throne, he
expressed his desire to "keep on" Sir Robert Walpole as minister, if
the situation continued to suit that individual, whose acknowledgment
that he was " very comfortable," concluded the arrangement for the
continuance of the existing government.


Walpole was one of the most dishonest ministers that ever lived,
and it was his policy to resort to corruption of the grossest kind to
ensure success; " for," as he would sometimes say, " the manure
must not be spared, if you wish for an abundant harvest." He
accordingly laid it on so extravagantly thick, that the expense of
the cultivation of his political connections was prodigious, and the
national resources were frequently dipped into, for the purpose of
serving the personal objects of the Minister. The sinking fund had
a tremendous hole made in it, where—to steal a figure from the
plumber's art—a waste-pipe was inserted, and laid on to the pocket
of the premier, who, collecting the floating capital into a private
reservoir of his own, turned it on among his creatures with great
prodigality. To meet the drain that was going on, new taxes were
imposed, or in other words, the people were treated as if they had
been an Artesian well, and were bored to the most frightful extent
for the sort of currency by which a liquidation of the liabilities
of the state was to be effected.


The nation, recognising a swindling spirit in its rulers, gave
symptoms of the imitative mania which invariably causes the vices of
the great to be copied by the little. Speculations of the wildest and
most dishonest nature were set on foot among every class, from the
<!-- Leaf 428, Page: 388 -->
highest to the lowest, and there is no question that the Rogue's
March would have been the most appropriate National Anthem for
the period. From quiet fraud, the country soon fell into downright
robbery, and the people got into the habit of plundering each other
in the thoroughfares, without going through the formality—common
in our own days—of issuing a prospectus, and advertising a project.
The first advertisement generally came upon the victim in the shape
of a blow upon the head in the public streets, the preliminary
deposit was extorted from him in the shape of the first article of
value that could be easily snatched away, and the calls were
exacted in rapid succession by a demand upon every one of his
pockets. There was no hope of protection from the police, for
the members of the force were too busy in robbing on their own
account, to bother themselves about the robberies that were being
committed by others.


It was, in fact, a case of Every Man his Own Pickpocket;
and protection, being everybody's business, was soon considered
nobody's business, until the whole kingdom was exposed to a sort of
daily scramble, in the course of which Shakspeare's description of
logo's purse, " 'Twas mine, 'tis his," was every hour realised.
Things were, of course, in a most unsettled state, for nobody thought
of settling anything—not even a washing bill—during the existence
of the universal plunder system, and a riot every other day was the
ordinary average of popular turbulence. Even the Scotch grew
warm, and becoming conscientiously opposed to the legal infliction
of death, they attended the execution of a smuggler to make a great
moral demonstration against capital punishment. In the excess
of their philanthropic sympathy with the convict, they began pelting
the authorities, who were on the point of being murdered, when
John Porteus, the captain of the guard, interfered to save the lives
of his comrades. Some time afterwards, the philanthropists, to prove
their consistent abhorrence of the punishment of death, seized upon
Porteus, who had officiated in keeping the peace at the execution,
and hanged him at the Salt Market.


In the year 1737 the queen died, and the king set up a piteous
howl, though he had ill-used her majesty on many occasions; but it
<!-- Leaf 429, Page: 389 -->
was well remarked by a philosopher of the period, that by the
sincerity with which George II. wept her dead, he almost teaches us
to forget the severity with which he wapt her living.


The year 1740 was rendered remarkable by a severe frost, which
confined Father Thames to his bed with a dreadful cold, until the
17th of February, from the 26th of December previous. A fair was
held on the ice, but amid these rejoicings the watermen were
dissatisfied at being deprived of their ordinary fare, and the fishermen
complained that they had been able to net nothing during the
frost's continuance.


The disputes of the Continent furnished occupation, as usual, for
English troops and English money, nor was it long before a
difference between the Elector of Bavaria and Maria Theresa caused the
Earl of Stair to be sent to keep his eyes open, with 16,000 men, in
the lady's interest. Stair, after staring at 60,000 Frenchmen face to
face for some time, began to think he had a very poor look-out,
though joined by the king himself, and his son, the Duke of
Cumberland. The whole three of them got beaten like so many old sacks
by Marshal Saxe at the battle of Fontenoy. Cumberland, who had
put his best leg foremost, got it badly wounded. George rode along
the lines—at the back, we believe—urging on the soldiers to fight
for their king, while Stair seems to have been lost sight of, or
perhaps to have run away, though we must admit that this flight of
Stairs must be considered apocryphal.


While these disasters were going on abroad, a correspondence
was being kept up between the Pretender, James Stuart, and his
British friends, who promised that if he or his son Charles Edward
would effect a landing in Scotland, there should be a good supply of
horses and carriages; but one would imagine his friends were a
parcel of job-masters, by the quality of the aid they tendered, and
indeed a job was their object, for all but the most unprincipled of the
party were for abandoning the hopeless project.


Though James himself was a bird far too venerable to be attracted
by Caledonian chaff, his son was sanguine enough to hope that by
coming over to be met by a few glass coaches and hackney chariots,
<!-- Leaf 430, Page: 390 -->
his cause would be aided. He wrote to say when he might be
expected, and without waiting for an answer, he put to sea in a
small frigate. He was joined by the Elizabeth, a sixty-gun ship,
when an English liner, called the Lion, appeared on the foaming
main, and an engagement commenced, which rendered it necessary
for the Elizabeth to go into Brest harbour for refuge. At the end of
eighteen days he reached the Hebrides, but the prospect was so
wretched that the few adherents who met him recommended him
very strongly to be off again as speedily as possible.


Charles Edward was however obstinate, and on the i ith of August,
1745, he took out of his portmanteau and unfurled the standard of the
Stuarts in the pass of Glenfinnan. Attempts were made to obtain
recruits, but they poured, or rather dribbled in so slowly, that the whole
insurrection might have been broken up had it been nipped in the
bud; but while Sir John Cope, the commander of the king's forces,
was capering about the hills, and dragging his army of flats across the
mountains, the young Charles Edward gained time enough to add to
the strength of his company. Cope not coming up to cope with the
rebels, they pushed on to Perth and Stirling, but they soon made an
acquisition of still more sterling value, by taking possession of
Edinburgh. Here the young prince, who had landed only with seven
adherents, found himself at the head of four thousand men, most of
whom had neither arms nor discipline, but brimming over with the
froth of enthusiasm, they presented to their chief a refreshing aspect.


Sir John Cope, having fumbled his way out of the hills, had got
to Preston among the pans, where he was seized with a panic, and
being set upon by the Scotch, was utterly routed. Returning to
Edinburgh after his success, Prince Charles Edward had King James
proclaimed in the usual form; and the King of France, who had
stood aloof while the result was doubtful, sent over a small parcel of
arms and a few packets of powder, by way of encouragement. He
promised also that a French army should soon follow the arms, for
Charles Edward had no soldiers to match the matchless matchlocks
that had arrived from the French sovereign. Trusting to the word
of his Gallic Majesty, the young Pretender ventured to cross the
border in a blue bonnet, attended by a large body of adherents in the
<!-- Leaf 431, Page: 391 -->
same interesting coiffure, and on the 29th of November, 1745, he fixed
his head-quarters at Manchester.


The news of the approach of the rebel army spread the utmost
consternation in England, and the alarm excited in London was
something utterly indescribable. People who lived in town rushed

into the country to be out of the way, and the inhabitants of the
provinces poured into the metropolis as the best place for avoiding
danger. The householders took up arms, and formed themselves
into squares, crescents, lanes, streets, alleys, or anything. Some
bolted their doors, others bolted themselves, and all gave
unspeakable symptoms of terror and confusion. A camp was ordered to be
formed in the suburbs, and after getting a large force together, it was
at first resolved to turn 'em out at Turnham Green, but Finchley was
at length decided upon as the place of rendezvous.

<!-- Leaf 432, Page: 392 -->

George, who had been summoned from Germany, came blustering
over to England, and began immediately to boast, in bad grammar
and wretched pronunciation, that he would "vite vor his Binglish
bossessions," and would "meet the Bretender how or where he
bleased." His personal valour was not put to the test, for Charles
Edward, who had expected instalments of friends to continue meeting
him at every large town, had the mortification to find that the more
he kept looking for them the more they kept on not coming; and
eventually, by the unanimous voice of his officers, he was compelled
to retreat. When he first heard their decision, he observed that the
messenger must be joking, and his features wore a faint smile, but
when the porter who brought the intelligence shook his head as
much as to say, "It's no joke, your honour," the features of the young
Pretender fell, and those who watched him narrowly for the rest of
his life, declare that he was never afterwards seen to smile again.


It is impossible to recite the misfortunes of Charles Edward
without a feeling of grave sympathy at the failure of the many noble
qualities with which he was endowed. In April, 1746, he advanced
to Culloden, intending to astonish the English, but he and his
followers, like the individuals named in the song who had resolved
to " astonish the Browns," finished by astonishing no one but
themselves.


The rebels advanced in two columns; but the soldiers fell asleep,
and we are not surprised at the fact, for any newspaper reader will
admit that in the very idea of two columns there is
somethinosoporific in the extreme. The exhausted troops fell from fatigue;
others lost their way; and the second column found it impossible to
keep up with the first. This threw a damp upon the energies of even
the boldest; and with a mental ejaculation of " Oh ! it's no use," the
very best of Charles Edward's adherents retired. Notwithstanding
the valour of a corps consisting of picked men, there arose among
them a feeling of dissatisfaction at standing unsupported, to be
picked out by the artillery of the enemy; and though one gallant
body withdrew, playing on their pipes, the pipes were very soon put
out by a smart shower of bullets. Such was the upshot of one of the
most spirited enterprises that ever was undertaken; and its Chief,
<!-- Leaf 433, Page: 393 -->
the unfortunate Charles Edward, became a pauper fugitive, with
scarcely clothes to cover him, and there was quite as much necessity
as nationality in the bareness of his legs, during the period of
his wanderings.


One of these fogs which are so accommodating in romance, but
very rarely present themselves opportunely in history, was obliging
enough to make its appearance for that night only on an evening of
September, 1746, and by its kind assistance in doing the heavy
business on that occasion, Charles Edward was enabled to pass
unobserved through an English squadron, and cross in a vessel to
Morlaix in Brittany. The unfortunate Pretender seems to have
taken his discomfiture so seriously to heart, that from a fine spirited
young fellow, he lapsed into all sorts of excess, and having taken to
drinking, he fell into a constant reel, which formed the sole
remaining vestige of his once enthusiastic nationality. Sir Nathaniel
Wraxall, walking about Florence in the year 1799, tumbled over an
intoxicated individual, and raising him from the ground, had no
sooner carried him towards a light, than he recognised the features
of the young Pretender.


Matters might possibly have gone on very peaceably with England,
for there was nothing to fight about at home, but a dispute arose with
the French about the respective influence of the two nations in some
of their distant colonies. A contest for the Nabobship between some
of the native tribes in the Carnatic, became the subject of a desperate
quarrel between the two great European powers; one of whom
supported the claims of Anwar ad Dien, the other promoting the
pretensions of Chunda Sahib, and both caring, in fact, not a button
about either. A war was nevertheless entered upon with intense
vehemence, and was carried on for some time, with alternating
success; but, not having the bulletins of the day at hand, and the
despatches being equally out of the way, we are unable to give the
particulars of the various contests. The quarrelling, though at a
great distance, made at the time sufficient noise to be disagreeably
audible at home, and preparations were made in the two mother
countries to send out large forces to thrash the children on both
sides out of their turbulence.  
  
  
  VOL. II. J
<!-- Leaf 434, Page: 394 -->

Though all this bickering had been going on for some time in the
colonies, war had not been formally declared; but whenever an
English or a French vessel had a chance of worrying the other,
each made the most of the opportunity. On one occasion, two
French sail of the line got treated very unceremoniously, and
eventually captured; when the government of Paris began
expressing a great deal of surprise and indignation, and professing
utter ignorance of the fact that the two powers were quarrelling. It
is absurd to suppose that France was sincere in this declaration, for
it could not have been understood to be " only in fun," that the
French and English were knocking each other about most
unmercifully and energetically in America. The circumstance of the
capture to which we have referred, caused an immediate
understanding that both parties were henceforth in earnest; and there was
a mutual calling in of their outstanding ambassadors.


George, however, instead of thinking about the colonies, became
solicitous only about his " little place " at Hanover, and while he
neglected therefore the American war, which became a series of
mishaps, he threw his whole strength into the defence of the
wretched spot, that would not have been " had at a gift" even by
the ambitious enemy.


Higher game was, in fact, in view; and the possession of the
rock of Gibraltar and the island of Minorca by the English having
long been envied, the French made up their minds to have a dash at
one of them. Gibraltar was speedily pronounced impracticable,
but Minorca seemed to be in a state of helplessness that tempted
a resolute foe, and Fort St. Philip was suddenly invested. No
preparations having been made for defence, the authorities ran
about asking each other anxiously what was to be done, for most of
the officers of the garrison were absent on leave; and General
Blakeney, who was on the spot, though a very gallant fellow, was
old and shaky. His spirit was consequently, more effective as a fine
piece of acting than for the purposes of actual war; and though the
old fellow, tottering about in his dressing-gown and slippers, might
have exclaimed, "Aye, aye—let'em come; I'm ready for them,"
and have relapsed with affecting feebleness into the sufferings of a
<!-- Leaf 435, Page: 395 -->
gouty twinge, the spectacle, which might have been beautiful on the
boards of a theatre, was, in the midst of a town threatened with a
siege, most painfully ridiculous.


Relief was ordered from Gibraltar; but the Governor, who was
either very stupid or did not like the job, pretended to, or really did
misunderstand the purport of the instructions sent out to him. At
home, the same want of energy prevailed, for the acting representative
of the Government picked out a few ill-manned vessels, which he
dignified with the name of a squadron; and calling to him an
admiral, since notorious but then unknown, observed to him, " Here,
Byng; you had better take this force, and go and see what they
want at Fort St. Philip." Admiral Byng did not at all like the job,
and began to hesitate about undertaking it; but being told to call
at Gibraltar for fresh troops, he plucked up sufficient pluck for
the enterprise.


On his arrival at Gibraltar, the Governor pretended not to know
what Byng had come about; and when asked for troops, merely
exclaimed, " Nonsense, nonsense; there's some mistake. I can't
part with my troops, for I am as nervous as an old aspen myself,
with the very little protection that is left to me." Byng became
more disheartened than ever by the refusal of the expected aid, and
went grumbling away, muttering, " Well! they'll see; I know how
it will end; " and giving vent to other ejaculations of a similarly
unseaman-like character. He wrote to the Lords of the Admiralty,
announcing the certainty of his making a mess of it; and in
speaking of the refusal of troops at Gibraltar, he in vulgar but forcible
language " gave it the Governor."


Having made up his mind to a failure, it was not very difficult
to accomplish the object; and having gone to look at Fort St. Philip,
he merely played, as it were, a game at stare-cap with the sentinel
on the look-out, but did not perform a single operation with a view
to its protection. In due course the French fleet hove in sight, and
it was expected that a brilliant action would have taken place, for
both squadrons immediately began manœuvring most beautifully
until each had got into the line of battle. A little harmless
cannonading had commenced by way of overture to the anticipated
<!-- Leaf 436, Page: 396 -->
work, when the French slowly retired, and the English slowly
following, they disappeared together in the most harmless and indeed
almost friendly manner, to the astonishment of poor old Blakeney,
who watched them as long as the strength of his glasses would allow
of his doing so. Nothing could have been more orderly than the
retreat on both sides; and indeed it has been suggested by an old
offender, who very naturally refuses to give his name—"That if the.
affair we have described deserves to be called a battle at all, the
Battle of Co-runner "—mark the deceptive spelling in the last syllable
—" would be a good name for it."


The rage of the English, whose boast it had been to rule the
waves, and never, never, never to be slaves, may be conceived at the
arrival of the intelligence of Byng's bungle. The Government was
the first object of the popular fury; but the ministers were adroit
enough to turn the indignation of the people against the unfortunate
admiral. Byng was, no doubt, bad enough, though he was not the
only guilty party; but his fellow-culprits, taking a lesson from the
pickpockets, who were the first to raise after their accomplice the cry
of "Stop thief," began to denounce the nautical delinquent with
excessive vehemence. They recalled him from his command, ordered
him to Greenwich, and instead of allowing him to partake in the
amusements of the place, they imprisoned him with the intimation
that "None but the brave deserved the fair." The next step was to
bring him before a Court-martial on a charge of cowardice and
disobedience to orders, when, being found guilty, he was condemned to
be shot, and underwent at Portsmouth, on the 14th of March, 1757,
this rather redundant punishment.


We are anxious to do what we can in the way of sympathy for
poor Byng, particularly after the little we find that can be of any
use to him in the pages of preceding historians. They seem disposed
to join in the cruel shout of " Sarve him right," which a vulgar and
unthinking posterity has raised to hoot the memory of this
unfortunate officer. We are induced to look at him as a gentleman who
merely was unfit for the profession he had chosen, and as his was
not an uncommon case, we think it hard to look upon it with
uncommon severity. It is perhaps an odd coincidence, that an officer
<!-- Leaf 437, Page: 397 -->
more eager for the fray than Byng, had urged the latter to enter into
the action with the French, when the dry observation, " I'll be shot
if I do," was the only reply of the admiral. It cannot fail to strike
the philosophic observer at this distance of time, that Byng, when
saying "I'll be shot if I do"—that is, if he ever said as
muchmight have been profitably given to understand that he would be
shot if he didn't. It has been put forth as a consolatory reflection
that the naval service in general profited by this melancholy
execution of poor Byng; but though, as a general rule, what is desirable
for the goose is equally advantageous to the gander, we cannot in
this instance agree that what was good for the men was at the same
time good for the admiral.


The treatment of poor Byng presents a very humiliating picture
of the want of firmness shown by the Court-martial that tried, the
ministers that abandoned, and the king that would not pardon him.
Everybody affected a strong desire to see him saved, but nobody had
the resolution to take the responsibility of saving him. His
sometimes merciless Majesty, the mob, formed in reality the executioners
of poor Byng, for the authorities were all afraid of risking their
popularity by being instrumental to his pardon. The members of
the Court-martial, by their verdict, expressly implored the Lords of
the Admiralty to recommend him to the mercy of the Crown, but
there was a general feeling of " It's no business of mine," and to this
heartless apathy poor Byng was eventually sacrificed.


Never was there a better illustration of the hare with many
friends, though not even a hair-breadth escape was permitted to the
unfortunate admiral. Never was a gentleman killed under such an
accumulation of kindness as Byng, and indeed he was, figuratively
speaking, bowed out of existence with so many complimentary and
sympathetic expressions, that but for the stubborn reality of the
leaden bullets, he might have fancied that the guns discharged at
him were intended rather in the nature of a salute than as a
capital punishment.

our country's annals belonging to this period should be written, for
in India alone were any of our achievements entitled to some of
those epithets we are so fond of bestowing on our own actions. The
British Lion had, in fact, retired from the Continent to the
Himalaya mountains, where he remained on the majestic prowl as the
protector of British interests.


There was a natural jealousy between England and France on
the subject of their relative influence in that country, whose native
princes were honoured by the protection of both, and who were
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P438_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 439, Page: 399 -->
always mulcted of a slice of their dominions by way of costs, for the
expense incurred in the alleged support of their interests. If the
aggressor of one of the Indian rulers happened to succeed, he took at
once what he had been fighting for; while if a defender of some
unhappy rajah or nabob was victorious, the native prince was made
to pay all the same for the protection afforded him.


By this sort of assistance rendered to the Indians, the English
and French had succeeded in helping themselves to a good share of
territory, and while the former had already obtained possession of
Calcutta and Madras, the latter had got at Pondicherry, a veryrespectHostilities between England and France.

able establishment under Monsieur Duplex, whose duplicity was, of
course, remarkable. By espousing the causes of a set of quarrelsome
nabobs, soubahdars, and other small fry, who had taken advantage
of the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk to raise a contest for the throne of the
Deccan, the English and the French had found plenty of excuses for
quarrelling, and we are compelled to confess that in this part of
the world the Gallic cock had good reason for crowing over the
British bull-dog.

Things might have continued in this unsatisfactory condition, had
not Captain Clive, a civilian in the Company's service, exchanged a
pen for a sword—a piece of barter that turned out extremely
fortunate for English interests. With a small body of troops he took the
Citadel of Arcot, nabbed the Nabob, and prevented Duplex from
setting up a creature of his own—a disagreeable Indian creature—in
that capacity. After this achievement, Clive had gone home for his
health, and was drinking every morning a quantity of Clive's tea,
when in 1755 he accepted a colonelcy, and returned to the scene of
his former glories. Here he was rendered very angry by a pirate of
the name of Angria, whom however he quickly subdued : and he had
heard from Madras that a mad-rascal named Suraja Dowlar was in
the neighbourhood of Calcutta, and was threatening to settle the
settlement. This news came like a thunder-clap on Clive, who
determined on giving Dowlar such a dose as he would not easily
forget; and he commenced by conveying secretly to one of his
officers, Meer Jaffier—a mere nobody—an offer of the throne. The
scheme completely succeeded, and Meer Jaffier became the tool, or
rather the spade, for giving a dig at poor Dowlar, who fell to the
ground very speedily.


Matters had now happily taken a favourable turn, and in America
Wolfe distinguished himself, but unfortunately extinguished himself
also at the siege of Quebec; for he died in the moment of victory.


Things were mending very perceptibly in all directions, and
English honour, which had been for some time at an unusual
discount, was once more looking up, when the king, who had been
speculating on the rise, was suddenly deprived of all chance of
sharing in its advantages. He had made his usual hearty breakfast
of chocolate, new-laid eggs, devilled kidneys, tea-cake, red-herrings,
and milk from the cow, when, as he was preparing to take a walk in
Kensington Gardens, he suddenly expired, on the 25th of October,
1760. George II. was in his 77th year, and the 34th of his reign,
during the whole of which he had been a Hanoverian at heart, and
he had nothing English about him, except the money. His manners
were rather impatient and over-bearing, for he had not a courteous
style of speaking; and it was said at the time, that "no one could
<!-- Leaf 441, Page: 401 -->
accuse him of being mealy-mouthed; for though he was not civil
spoken, he was temperate in his living, and thus the term
mealymouthed could in no sense be applied to him."


In forming an estimate of the characters of the sovereigns who
have come before us for review, we have found ourselves fortunate in
possessing an independent judgment of our own; for if we had been
guided by precedent, we should have been puzzled to know what to
think of the different kings and queens, all of whom have had
witnesses on both sides, to censure and to praise with a want of
unanimity that is really wonderful. George II. has furnished a
subject for this division of opinion, and his eulogist has
complimented him rather oddly on his old age, a compliment that might
as well be paid to an old hat, an ancient pun, a venerable bead, or
any other article that has arrived at a condition of antiquity. The
reasons given by his panegyrist for praising him are few and
insignificant on the whole, though his severer critic founds his strictures
on a tolerably substantial basis. We learn from this authority that
George II. was ignorant, stingy, stupid, ill-tempered, and obstinate.
His predilection for Hanover has, we think, been unjustly censured;
for there is nothing very discreditable, after all, in a love for one's
own birth-place, though it may be what is termed a beggarly hole in
the strong language of detraction. The native of Lambeth has been
known to pine with a sort of mat du pays after the cherished sheds
and shambles of the New Cut, and we have heard the plaintive
accents of "Home, sweet Home," issuing from the lips of the exiled
sons and daughters of Houndsditch. If George II. was still faithful
in his love for Hanover, in spite of the superior attractions of England,
we may question his taste, but we must admire his constancy; which
presents an honourable contrast to young Love's notorious desertion
of the coal and potato shed, when Poverty, in the shape of a man in
possession, stepped over the doorway.

which we allude, it will be unnecessary to hold the reader very
long by the button; but perceiving him getting ready to run away,
as the curtain falls upon George H., we cannot help exclaiming,
\"Stop a minute or two, we've got just half-a-dozen more words
to say to you ! "


The Constitution is the first topic on which we have still to touch,
and that is a theme which every true patriot loves to dwell upon.
We have no hesitation in saying that our beloved country must have
the constitution of a horse, to have gone through one-half the severe
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P442_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 443, Page: 403 -->
trials it has experienced. It is apparently peculiar to the soil; for,
though the prescription for making it up has been given to other
nations, and has been accurately prepared by some of the ablest
political druggists, it has never been swallowed abroad, or, if
rammed down the throats of rulers or people, it does not seem to
have agreed very well with either one or the other. The British
Constitution is a thing sui generis, like the delicious bun of Chelsea, the
acknowledged brick of Bath, and the recognised toffey of Everton.
It is vain for other nations to hope that they may have their own
materials made up into the pattern they so much admire; for the
attempt would be quite as abortive, and almost as unwise, as the
effort to make a genuine Romford stove away from Romford, Epsom
salts half a mile out of Epsom, Windsor soap beyond the walls of
Windsor, and the genuine Brighton rock anywhere in the world but
in the very heart of Brighton. The British Constitution must be
like home-brewed beer, and even more than that, it must be enjoyed
where it is brewed; or, in other words—to draw off one more figure
from the cask,—it must be " drunk on the premises." The most
eloquent of foreign nations cannot come and fetch it, as it were, in
their own jugs, however they may foam and froth about it in their
own mugs when they carry it in their mouths by making it the subject
of their speeches.


The durability of the British Constitution, its fitness for wear and
tear, has been exemplified in the wonderful manner in which it has
survived the rubs that from the hands of party it has experienced.
This reflection naturally brings into our mind the terms Whig and
Tory, into which politicians were divided, until modern
statesmanship introduced us to a new class of principles, that may be called,
concisely and comprehensively, the Conservative-Whig-Radical.


The words Whig and Tory came into use, and into abuse also,
about the year 1679, and their origin has been traced with wonderful
ingenuity, for the derivation has nothing to do with the derivative,
according to these ingenious speculations; and if we may trust
Roger North—a little too far north for us, by-the-bye—Tory is
allied to Tantivy, without the smallest apparent reason for the
relationship. It would, perhaps, save a great deal of trouble to keep
<!-- Leaf 444, Page: 404 -->
a register of philological next-of-kin; and we are sure that if
something a little nearer than Tantivy could come forward to claim affinity
with Tory, the noun, verb, or any other part of speech it might
chance to be, would " hear of something to its advantage." The
word Whig seems to be utterly without orthographical heirs-at-law,
for no attempt has been made to get at its pedigree.


National industry advanced materially during the period we have
just described, and among other things, the glass, which had been
hitherto imported chiefly from France, began to be seen through by
the English manufacturer.


Literature and the Arts flourished in the reigns we have lately
gone through; and Architecture took very high ground, or indeed
any ground it could get, for the execution of its projects.


Periodical Literature rose in great brilliancy at about the time we
have described, and the union of such writers as Steele, Addison,
and Swift, in one little paper, must have formed a combination that
should have been kept back until the days of advertising vans, and
gigantic posting-bills, enabling the parties interested to make the
most of the " Concentration of talent," which might have been the
cry of every dead wall in the Metropolis.


The manners and customs of the period were not particularly
attractive, being, under the two Georges at least, far more German
than Germane to our English notions of refinement. In dress, there
was somewhat of an approach to the costume of our own days; and
the scarcity of hair on the head began to be supplied by that friend
of man, the horse, from whom the barrister has since prayed a tales to
furnish the wig, which is considered essential to his forensic dignity.


The military costume of the time of George II. is chiefly
remarkable for the hats worn by the soldiers, which were something in
appearance between the fool's cap and the bishop's mitre, as we find
from one of Hogarth's drawings.


The condition of the people was not very enviable in the
seventeenth or even the eighteenth centuries; and indeed all classes
were very ill-conditioned; for morality was lax, education was
<!-- Leaf 445, Page: 405 -->
limited, poverty was abundant, extravagance was very common, and
wealth extremely insolent.


Such being the state of the people and the country at this period,
we cannot be sorry to get out of their company, though it is not
without some regret that we bid farewell for a time to our History.
In the course of this work we have rowed in the same galley with
Cæsar, stood up to our ankles in sea-water with Canute, run after the
Mussulman's daughter with Gilbert a Becket, wielded a battle-axe
with Richard on the field of Bosworth, smoked a pipe and eaten a
potato with Sir Walter Raleigh, danced with Sir Christopher
Hatton on Clerkenwell Green, and sailed round the bay that bears
his name with honest Bill Baffin: all these adventures have we
enjoyed in imagination, that beau ideal of a railway, with nothing to
pay and no fear of accidents.


We have at length arrived at a station, where we stop for the
purpose of refreshment; but we hope to resume our journey, and
proceed in the ordinary train, touching by the way at all stations,
high and low, to the terminus we have set our eye upon.
